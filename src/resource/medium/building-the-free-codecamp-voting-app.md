The voting app challenge on freeCodeCamp was the first freeCodeCamp project in the curriculum that struck me as really hard. I just couldn’t do it as easily as all the other challenges. So much knowledge in of so many concepts is necessary to build it.

I didn’t find any tutorials or examples that broke this challenge down with up-to-date tools. So I decided to document my process of building it.

In this tutorial, will use:

*   MongoDB
*   Express
*   React + Redux
*   Node.js

also known as the “MERN-Stack”.

### What this article is about

I will describe the process of building the voting app for the [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

This is not an optimized example for building the application. I am open for feedback of any kind. I am still a beginner and also left some things open.

This is not designed as a tutorial! It’s simply a documentation I wrote while building the app.

### Structure

I will divide this article into sections of back-end, front-end, data visualization and the deployment process. The project will be available as open source code on GitHub. That is where you can follow up with commits and the end result.

### Development Environment

*   Plain [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (JS framework)
*   [MongoDB](https://mlab.com/) (Database)
*   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (package management)
*   [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Code as editor
*   [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (testing APIs)
*   [Robomongo / Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) (working faster with MongoDB)

### Packages / Features / Dependencies

### Deployment / DevOps

*   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (PaaS to run applications in the cloud)
*   (Unit)Testing: Not implemented in this app (but normally it should be)

### First things first

First I will set up my environment:

*   add [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
*   create your package management with [yarn init](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/init/)
*   add [express](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for a fast web development
*   add the [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) package for restarting your server on changes
*   add eslint.rc for your [eslint](https://eslint.org/) configuration
*   add [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and corresponding plugins for compiling JS

As additional integration I’ll use:

*   [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (for continuous integration)
*   [Code Climate](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate) (for Code quality)
*   [Assertible](https://assertible.com/) (Monitoring Web Services, especially checking deployment — Quality Assurance)

Here is my commit on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/23a05a550f6e2e34cb182d3a271a4c44028d07f9) after the setup.

### Back-end

For me, the back-end is most difficult. So that’s where I’ll start.

#### Set up Packages, Middleware and Mongoose

I will use:

*   [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) for parsing request bodies
*   [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for logging out HTTP requests
*   [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) for compressing response bodies
*   [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) for setting basic security with HTTP headers
*   [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) object modeling tool for asynchronous database connection

#### Next steps:

*   create a **constants** file to set your different environment variables and corresponding settings
*   create a **middlewar**e file to pass in middleware to your app and differentiate for environments. Use **bodyparser** and **morgan** packages here.
*   create a **database** file to set up the mongoDB connection
*   modularize your code and outsource your constants, middleware and database connection. This is for keeping smaller files.
*   import everything in your **app.js** file, pass in the `middleware` function and test your setup with a simple `http` request

Here’s my commit on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/88a2436697be4147302ce2dbcd3104ed564c86fe) after this setup.

#### Set up your routes

Revisit the User stories and lay out your routes accordingly.

Following the [CRUD approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete):

As an unauthenticated user I want to:

*   see all polls (R)
*   see individual polls (R)
*   vote on available polls (C)

As an authenticated user I want to

*   see and read all polls (R)
*   see individual polls (R)
*   vote on available polls (C)
*   create new polls (C)
*   create new options and votes (C)
*   delete polls (D)

Therefore:

*   set up [error handling as middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)
*   set up your [router object](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)
*   create your GET, POST, DELETE [routes](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) and response with JSON objects
*   test the set up routes with [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/requests) (all should have a status code of 200)
*   [connect your routes](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) to your middleware and app.js

#### Set up Mongoose and your Schemas and connect everything to your routes

When setting up Schemas think about how you want to structure the documents that you will store in the database. In this example we need to store the user for the authentication process and polls with answers.

For polls we need:

1.  the question
2.  answers and votes

*   create your [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) schemas and models
*   connect to [mlab](https://mlab.com/) to monitor your DB actions better

Be aware that MLab creates “System Collections.” They throw “duplicate key error index dup key: { : null }” error in postman, when creating new polls. Until now I haven’t found a solution but deleting all collections allows us to start again.

*   use the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to store your credentials in the environment and add the .env file to .gitignore (if you make your project open source)
*   connect you routes with your mongoose model to handle the documents in MongoDB

**Be Sure To Read the** [**Docs**](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) if you are stuck. This part is pretty hard when you haven’t done a lot with mongoose and MongoDB!

[Here’s what my commits looked like on Github after these steps](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/5dcd7359d2cb1b31e28a08869461b927094550c0).

#### Establish authentication and authorization with Twitter

I want to use the twitter sign-on as an [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) provider to authenticate. It provides better user experience and I also got to explore OAuth.

OAuth is a standard protocol that allows users to authorize API access to web and desktop or mobile applications. Once access has been granted, the authorized application can utilize the API on behalf of the user.

Of course I found [the great article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-twitter) on how to set up the authentication process in Nodejs. After I failed implement it properly in my app and it took me a whole day, I decided to dive straight into the [documentation of passport](http://passportjs.org/docs)!

I love the quote they put up there:

“Despite the complexities involved in authentication, code does not have to be complicated.”

**⭐ Again, as a reminder: Read the Documentation!**

*   register your app on [twitter apps](https://apps.twitter.com/) and get your settings right. Determine the Access Level and the Callback URL
*   add [passport](http://passportjs.org/), [passport-twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-twitter) and [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) packages to your application
*   create a file defining a passport strategy for Twitter
*   to support login session passport has to serialize and deserialize user
*   pass passport to your passport configuration and connect passport.initialize and passport.session to your app as middleware. Use express-session before this!
*   set up routes for authenticating and the callback

Check out my commit on [Github](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/d398cce56b1df2d042c07d2849223e88a5a2ed7f) after these steps.

After that, connect the authentication process to your database

⭐ Tip: Use for your callback and testing always `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` instead of `http://localhost:3000/`, since it solves a lot of problems, that might occur using passport-twitter. 😉

*   create a mongoose Schema for your users to track them in your database
*   fill the callback function of your passport.js file when implementing the twitter strategy. Filter your database for the user and create a new one if a user is not existing
*   use the [connect-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo) package to create a mongoStore and store your sessions in MongoDB
*   create a function to test if a user is authenticated. Implement it in your desired routes when providing sufficient authorization

The implementation can look like this:

<pre name="bc70" id="bc70" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">passport.use(  
		new Strategy(constants.TWITTER_STRATEGY, (req, token, tokenSecret, profile, cb) => {  
  process.nextTick(() => {  
    if (!req.user) {  
      User.findOne({ 'twitter.id': profile.id }, (err, user) => {  
        if (err) return cb(err);  
        if (user) {  
          if (!user.twitter.token) {  
            user.twitter.token = token;  
            user.twitter.username = profile.username;  
            user.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;  
            user.save(() => {  
              if (err) return cb(err);  
              return cb(null, user);  
            });  
          }  
          return cb(null, user);  
        }</pre>

<pre name="26cb" id="26cb" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">						// if no user is found create one  
        const newUser = new User();</pre>

<pre name="a42f" id="a42f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">        newUser.twitter.id = profile.id;  
        newUser.twitter.token = token;  
        newUser.twitter.username = profile.username;  
        newUser.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;</pre>

<pre name="7107" id="7107" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">        newUser.save(() => {  
          if (err) return cb(err);  
          return cb(null, newUser);  
        });  
      });  
    } else {  
					// when user already exists and is logged in  
      const user = req.user;</pre>

<pre name="b9a7" id="b9a7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">      user.twitter.id = profile.id;  
      user.twitter.token = token;  
      user.twitter.username = profile.username;  
      user.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;</pre>

<pre name="b5d1" id="b5d1" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">      user.save((err) => {  
        if (err) return cb(err);  
        return cb(null, user);  
      });  
    }  
  });  
}),  
	);</pre>

After that your authentication and authorization with Twitter is done.

[Here’s what my commits looked like on Github after these steps](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/cb96c8b2062f5c634efcba2b258e3ad054799c48).

#### Establish local authentication and authorization

The next step is to authenticate locally. There is actually not much to it, since we have already set up the environment.

*   update your user schema for local by defining email and password
*   add the [bcrypt-nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) package for securing passwords
*   add hashing and validating password methods to your Schema
*   define the routes. This process always clarifies what I actually want to implement

I had a main issue which I was only able to resolve after many hours of searching. Here is the example from the [docs](http://passportjs.org/docs/configure):

<pre name="e85e" id="e85e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">app.get('/login', function(req, res, next) {  
  passport.authenticate('local', function(err, user, info) {  
    if (err) { return next(err); }  
    if (!user) { return res.redirect('/login'); }  
    req.logIn(user, function(err) {  
      if (err) { return next(err); }  
      return res.redirect('/users/' + user.username);  
    });  
  })(req, res, next);  
});</pre>

Passing in the authentication in the callback function provided enough flexibility for displaying errors. But it’s very important to create the session explicitly with `logIn()`!

*   make sure to differentiate in the routes between signup and login!
*   I installed EJS as view engine to actually being able to test my signup and login properly and efficient
*   create a logout route, that destroys your session

I spent so many hours on an Error that I want to display it here: MongooseError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value “favicon.ico” at path “_id”

I solved it through checking all middleware which had a major error, and routes. It turned out that setting a route to (‘/:pID’) is not good when working in development.

Check out my commit on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/30e9627ba3ac2c6b45c64bf2bad4df5726e15a67) after the back-end setup.

Of course at this point the back-end is not perfect. But it’s stable enough to go to the next step, the front-end.

Things to do:

*   use validation with [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi)
*   write unit tests

### Frontend

#### Think before you do!

First of all think about what you want to create. Draw out some sketches to visualize what you want to build.

Then consider appropriate frameworks. I will choose [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) and the state management library [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). The size of this application does **not** necessarily require the use of Redux.

I want to build it as a single page experience. I want to have scalability and I like to practice the use of Redux. So, it’s a good fit.

Start planning everything out [thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

#### Necessary setup with Babel and Webpack

It’s important to realize that [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) are not too complicated to set it up yourself. There are so many tutorials for both that you can do it easily yourself.

*   add Babel for React and ES2015:  
    Add babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 to your dev dependencies to compile JSX into JS and have all ES6 features.
*   update your **.babelrc** file
*   update your **webpack config** and add the [react-hot-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hot-loader) package

First I want to structure my front-end without the back-end to connect the whole front-end with the back-end at the end. This is because right now I don’t know how my Redux implementation will look. So progressively connecting to the back-end wouldn’t be efficient.

*   restructure your current **app.js** into an own folder
*   create a new app.js as entry point and provide the [basic setup code](https://medium.com/@dabit3/beginner-s-guide-to-react-router-53094349669) for rendering a simple page
*   get the setup working. Install the react-router, webpack-dev-server and react and react-dom packages
*   opening a page on the dev-server port should display your react component

[Here’s what my commits looked like on Github after these steps](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/9ed98937551ad5eb3208be392040b39c35d4d231).

#### Structure components

I sketched everything out on a paper and came to the conclusion that I need to build 14 components:

*   the app component, that hosts everything
*   a header
*   a footer
*   a sidebar
*   a signup, login and social media component
*   a home screen
*   a list of all polls
*   the display of a single poll
*   a component for the poll and it’s answers
*   the answers as a list
*   the chart
*   a 404 page

That layout was for the start and should provide an overview. It is very natural to adapt the component structure when the application is evolving.

#### Design and build components

*   I lay out all the components and styled them with [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/). Materialize is a responsive design framework.
*   remember that styling with React is more complicated than styling normal HTML elements. For simplicity reasons I fixed everything with inline styling on the component itself.

Tip: For 100vh on your main content use this inline style on a div. It fits perfectly into the Materialize flexbox:

<pre name="163c" id="163c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">style={{  
  display: 'flex',  
  minHeight: '100vh',  
  flexDirection: 'column',  
}}</pre>

*   As you build components you will get a feeling on how you need to structure your state management with React and Redux

Check out my commit on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/eb17c360e09515f22f8ac38574f576a53855037b) after the components are built and styled

*   Now we have to set up React Router to get a basic functionality and feeling for the app
*   enable `historyApiFallback: true` on your webpack dev server to allow proper routing with react router
*   add state and it’s management to the components
*   realize that Redux might be a good next step

**Here is a list of painful learnings I had to undergo throughout this process:**

*   to access object properties, use bracket instead of dot notation. For example: JavaScript `answers = answers.concat(this.refs[temp].value)`
*   import everything as `* (import * as Polls from ‘./ducks/polls’;)` from ducks. Otherwise it will not work
*   I have often read to **not** use the index of a map function as a key value for a component. However, when rendering with `onChange` and generating a unique key, the input loses focus and does not work properly. For example:`(const answerList = this.state.answers.map((answer, ind) => { return ()`
*   when you iterate over an array of objects and want to change properties on an object you have to return an object. For example: `return{ answer: answ.answer, votes: 0};`   
    It took me 4 hours to understand 😞

The [Principles](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html) of Redux are:

*   Single source of truth
*   State is read-only
*   Changes are made with pure functions

Keep in mind, that local state doesn’t need to take part in Redux when it’s state isn’t used by other components.

*   add the [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) packages
*   make use of the [ducks structure](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) to manage the redux files better
*   create a store in Redux and wrap your rendering app in a `Provider` tag from react-redux
*   connect state to your application with `connect`
*   add the [Redux DevTool](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) to debug faster

Now that State is available through Redux, it’s time to create the event handlers and render everything properly. Now you should validate your your `propTypes` as well.

#### Visualization

For displaying the results I chose between:

*   [Recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleAreaChart)
*   [Victory](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs)
*   [React-Vis](http://uber.github.io/react-vis/#/)
*   [ReactD3](http://www.reactd3.org/docs/basic/#area)
*   [React-Google-Charts](https://github.com/RakanNimer/react-google-charts)

After skimming all docs and trying a few things out I ended up choosing React-Google-Charts. Google provides many options and the React wrapper makes it easy to implement in a React application.

With the React Wrapper this step was super easy and fast.

<pre name="25b0" id="25b0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">const resultChart = (props) => {  
  basic = [['Answer', 'Votes']];  
  (() => props.poll.answers.map(ans => basic.push([ans.answer, ans.votes])))();  
  return (  
    <Chart  
      chartType="PieChart"  
      data={basic}  
      options={{  
        title: `${props.poll.question}`,  
        pieSliceText: 'label',  
        slices: {  
          1: { offset: 0.1 },  
          2: { offset: 0.1 },  
          3: { offset: 0.1 },  
          4: { offset: 0.1 },  
        },  
        is3D: true,  
        backgroundColor: '#616161',  
      }}  
      graph_id="PieChart"  
      width="100%"  
      height="400px"  
      legend_toggle  
    />  
  );  
};</pre>

### Connect Front-end to the Express Back-end with React Router

#### Rendering client- and server-side

As this was my first real full-stack app, connecting the front-end and back-end was a mystery to me. I found a good answer to my question on Stack Overflow.

To summarize and quote the answer of [Stijn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/286685/stijn-de-witt):

> _“With client-side routing, which is what React-Router provides, things are less simple. At first, the client does not have any JS code loaded yet. So the very first request will always be to the server. That will then return a page that contains the needed script tags to load React and React Router etc. Only when those scripts have loaded does phase 2 start. In phase 2, when the user clicks on the ‘About us’ navigation link for example, the URL is changed locally only to_ [_http://example.com/about_](http://example.com/about) _(made possible by the History API), but no request to the server is made. Instead, React Router does it’s thing on the client side, determines which React view to render and renders it.”_

To read more of his comments click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928372/react-router-urls-dont-work-when-refreshing-or-writting-manually).

In the end I went with the catch-all solution: See in my [routes.js file](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/blob/master/src/serverSideES6/routes.js).

<pre name="02c0" id="02c0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">//routes.js  
router.get('/*', (req, res) => {  
  const options = {  
    root: `${__dirname}/../../public/`,  
    dotfiles: 'deny',  
  };  
  res.sendFile('index.html', options);  
});</pre>

It was easy and fast to implement and covered the basic problems.

#### Serving everything all together

To understand that, the best way is to take a look at my [package.json file](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/blob/master/package.json).

The scripts say:

<pre name="382d" id="382d" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">"scripts": {  
		"start": "node src/serverSide/server.js",  
		"serve": "babel-node src/serverSideES6/server.js",  
		"dev": "npm-run-all --parallel dev:*",  
		"dev:client": "webpack-dev-server --hot",  
		"dev:server": "nodemon src/serverSide/server.js",  
		"build": "npm-run-all --parallel build:*",  
		"build:client": "webpack --progress",  
		"build:server": "babel src/serverSideES6 --out-dir src/serverSide"  
	},</pre>

The `build` script builds the files on the client and server side.

*   It compiles all my ES6 node.js code into ES5 so Heroku can read it as well
*   Webpack starts the bundling and transpiling of the client side such as from ES6 to ES5, and JSX to JavaScript.

The `dev` script serves everything in a development environment and (hot) reloading. Everything is as fast and smooth as possible, when changing the codebase.

The `start` script actually starts the back-end server, which also consumes the built and bundled front-end HTML, CSS, JavaScript, presenting the whole application.

### Deployment

For deploying the app, Heroku once again has proven to be the way to go.

Using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), the `Heroku logs` command helps a lot. I always had trouble setting up my app on the platform. But after solving all the errors the logs show, it becomes very easy.

Always important:

*   Be aware that devDependencies are not installed
*   Use the adequate build-pack. In this case it is for Node.js
*   Have `start` script or define one in your Procfile
*   Be sure to push the right branch from the right repository

### Conclusion

As you can see my documentation for this article gets worse and worse with the progress of the app. This is due to the fact that I got completely overwhelmed with Redux. I did other projects on the side and wasn’t able to keep track.

But don’t worry! I tried to name my commits as clear as possible. So you can traverse all commits for details in my Repository. See [Commits here](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/commits/master).

If you have questions feel free to ask :)

*   Repository on Github is available [here](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp).

# Best Gitter channels: Mathematics







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Mt_I3oPXSF4f7rD8GroPQw.png)







Many programmers claim that they don’t use much mathematics in their daily work — or some of them even admit they struggled with it in high school.

But knowing math will surely broaden your horizons as an engineer, and will make building software more satisfying.

If you’re looking to revive or build your math skills, these Gitter communities are a good place to start. Check out the list below and don’t hesitate to join the conversation.

*   [**sagemath/cloud**](https://gitter.im/sagemath/cloud)** — SageMathCloud** is a web-based [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing") and [course management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system "Learning management system") platform for computational mathematics. The goal of the SageMath Cloud project is to create a viable way to do computational mathematics collaboratively online.
*   [**mikera/vectorz-clj**](https://gitter.im/mikera/vectorz-clj?)** — **Fast matrix and vector maths library for Clojure — as a core.matrix implementation.
*   [**ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl**](https://gitter.im/ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl)** — **Julia suite for high-performance solvers of differential equations.
*   [**rsvp/randomsys**](https://gitter.im/rsvp/randomsys)** — **Algorithmic study of random systems. Reliable and unbiased random numbers are needed for a range of applications from numerical modeling to cryptographic communications. ANU researchers are generating true random numbers from a physical quantum source by splitting a beam of light into two beams and then measuring the power in each beam. Because light is quantised, the light intensity in each beam fluctuates about the mean. Those fluctuations, due ultimately to the quantum vacuum, can be converted into a source of random numbers.
*   [**funcool/cats**](https://gitter.im/funcool/cats)** — **Category Theory and Algebraic abstractions for Clojure and ClojureScript. [http://funcool.github.io/cats/latest/](http://funcool.github.io/cats/latest/)
*   [**non/algebra**](https://gitter.im/non/algebra) — Experimental project to lay out basic algebra type classes.
*   [**JuliaODE/ODE.jl**](https://gitter.im/JuliaODE/ODE.jl)** — **Various basic Ordinary Differential Equation solvers implemented in Julia.
*   [**Axelrod-Python/Axelrod**](https://gitter.im/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod)** — **A [research tool](http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/) to run Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma tournaments.
*   [**sympy/sympy**](https://gitter.im/sympy/sympy)— A computer algebra system written in pure Python. [http://sympy.org/](http://sympy.org/)
*   [**boostorg/geometry**](https://gitter.im/boostorg/geometry)—[ Boost.Geometry](http://boost.org/libs/geometry), part of collection of the [Boost C++ Libraries](http://github.com/boostorg), defines concepts, primitives and algorithms for solving geometry problems.
*   [**samyak-268/Linear-Algebra**](https://gitter.im/samyak-268/Linear-Algebra)** — **This library hosts C++ implementation of some of the routines which are most frequently encountered in Linear Algebra.
*   [**mattheath/base62**](https://gitter.im/mattheath/base62)** — **Base62 encoding for arbitrary precision integers.

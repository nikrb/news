### I love Podcasts and I think youâ€™ll love them,Â too.

I listen to hours of podcasts every week. Theyâ€™re a convenient way to learn new things when Iâ€™m running around and not able to read.

Thereâ€™s so much idle time every day when Iâ€™m commuting, or trying to rock my new-born to sleep. Podcasts help me fill that time with stories from developers, and insights about technology.

This Venn Diagram shows all the situations where listening to podcasts can complement your other learning:

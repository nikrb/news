# Best Gitter channels: Material Design

Material Design is a design language developed by Google. It consists of specifications for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices and different screen sizes. Material design is multidimensional in its ability to communicate and react to user’s actions — it has been developed for the purpose of providing a consistent and unified user experience, both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

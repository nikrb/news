# Commit to Yourself. Commit to a Nonprofit.

In case you missed it, [our October Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvIdwFTrttU) was jam-packed with several big announcements about our open source community.

My personal favorite announcement was Commit — our new program designed to give you external motivation in your quest to learn to code, as well as the opportunity to help nonprofits right away. Here’s how it works:

**You pledge to donate monthly to a nonprofit until you’ve earned your Front End or Full Stack Development Certification.**

The faster you achieve your goal, the less you’ll donate overall. In the meantime, you’ll start helping a nonprofit right away (before joining a Pro Bono Nonprofit Project) and feel external motivation to code every single day. It’s a win-win for everyone.

It’s easy to get distracted when you’re learning to code. There are so many languages and tools to choose from. And let’s be real here — so many Netflix shows to watch.

Commit will help you narrow your focus and reach your goal faster.

Your Code Portfolio will reflect which nonprofit you’re supporting and how much you’ve pledged. We’ll also keep a running total of the amount pledged by our community, tracking the impact we’re making on nonprofits everyday.

We’ve already completed over $420,000 in pro bono web development. If just a tenth of campers pledge $10 a month, we’ll also raise more than $100,000 per month for nonprofits.Now that’s coding for a cause.

Free Code Camp will always be free. But if you need some skin in the game to stay on track, choose an amount you can afford and [commit today](http://freecodecamp.com/commit).

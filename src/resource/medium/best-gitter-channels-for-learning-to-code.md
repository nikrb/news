# Best Gitter channels for: Learning to Code

If you’re learning to code in 2016, you’re in luck — thanks to a huge range of helpful websites, MOOCs, books, and learners’ communities, you’ve got everything you need right at your fingertips.

Whether you want to become a self-sufficient freelance developer, webmaster, data scientist, or just understand the basics of computer science, you’ll easily find resources for self-study.

On Gitter, there are plenty of learners’ communities to get involved with as well — we’ve listed some of them here for you:

*   [**FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp**](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp) — FreeCodeCamp is an open source community of people who learn to code and help nonprofits. Since its establishment 2 years ago, already over 1 million dollars has been donated in pro bono code to non-profits. With FreeCodeCamp, you can work through self-paced coding challenges, build projects, and earn certificates. Once you finish the first 1,200 hours of challenges, you’ll get to build a series of solutions for nonprofits. You’ll work in pairs, under the supervision of a volunteer project manager and a stakeholder from the nonprofit.
*   [**Open-source-society/rooms **](https://gitter.im/orgs/open-source-society/rooms)— Open Source Society University is a community of students of all levels, completing a comprehensive, project based, open-source computer science curriculum, helping each other and sharing their experiences and code through GitHub the community forums. This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science, Data Science, Game Development course on your own time, for free, with courses from the best universities in the World. The [curriculum](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/curriculum) includes 37 courses in 30 categories.
*   [**Learn-javascript-courses/javascript-questions**](https://gitter.im/learn-javascript-courses/javascript-questions)— “Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott” is an online course series designed to teach you the secrets pros use to build great apps with millions of users.
*   [**Numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc**](https://gitter.im/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc)— [“Practical Numerical Methods with Python”](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about) is an open online course hosted on an independent installation of the [Open edX](http://code.edx.org/) software platform for MOOCs. This project started in 2014 as a multi-campus, connected course (plus MOOC) on numerical methods for science and engineering. A course in numerical methods with Python for engineers and scientists contains currently 5 learning modules, with student assignments.
*   [**CS50x**](https://gitter.im/cs50/x)— [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science Course. This entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.CS50 is offered as CS50x through [edX](https://www.edx.org/) **—** even if you’re not a student at Harvard, you may take CS50 by registering for CS50x.
*   [**saasbook/MOOC**](https://gitter.im/saasbook/MOOC)— This [book](http://www.saasbook.info/) and the accompanying [free online courses on edX](http://www.saasbook.info/courses) teach essential Software Engineering skills via designing, building, testing, and deploying SaaS Web applications in the cloud. [Read what other students have said about the book and course](http://www.saasbook.info/stories).
*   [**Codingforeveryone**](https://gitter.im/orgs/codingforeveryone/rooms) — Coding for Everyone are community chatroom of organization run by [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/) — a free full-time coding course in the UK. Founders & Coders developed a peer-led model of learning. After completing the course, students are encouraged to join the freelance community and to contribute to a growing array of community activities, including the course itself.

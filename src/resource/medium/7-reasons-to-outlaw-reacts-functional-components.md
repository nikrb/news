# 7 Reasons to Outlaw React‚Äôs Functional Components

## Are React‚Äôs Functional Components Worth The¬†Cost?



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nywxB5PdmQq8zmB_TnMTbQ.jpeg)

Stop, collaborate, and¬†listen.



I‚Äôm spending the week consulting a team in Seattle to help [accelerate their transition to React](http://reactjsconsulting.com). Today, we discussed the [8 key decisions to make to standardize React development](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/8-key-react-component-decisions-cc965db11594).

I shared a few [reasons I‚Äôm a fan of functional components](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/8-key-react-component-decisions-cc965db11594). One response surprised me:

> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs forbid using functional components.‚Äù

Woah, really? We discussed the issue at length. Here‚Äôs why.

#### 1\. Conversion Hassle

Functional components don‚Äôt support state, refs, or lifecycle methods. They can‚Äôt extend PureComponent either. Sometimes, you‚Äôll create a functional component only to realize that you need one of these class-only features later. In these situations, it‚Äôs a hassle to manually convert to a function into a class.

**Edit**: Instead of converting to a class, you can enhance existing functional with lifecycle methods, state, and more via [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose).

#### 2\. Messy¬†Diffs

After you‚Äôve finished the conversion, the diff is noisy. Even a trivial one-line change results in a multi-line code review.

Here‚Äôs an example of converting a functional component to a class so that it can be declared a PureComponent.

If this component were declared as a class from the start, the true intent of the commit would be crystal clear‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit would require a 4 character change:

Conversion obscures the component‚Äôs history by creating the illusion that the component has been largely rewritten when in fact you may have made a very trivial change. The person who does the conversion will be ‚Äúblamed‚Äù for writing many lines that they merely changed for conversion reasons.

#### 3\. Minor Signal to Noise Differences

Compare a minimal class to a function, and the differences are minor. Remember, constructors are optional without state.

A class without default props is only 3 lines longer (due to explicit render and destructuring on separate line). Without destructuring a class is only 2 lines¬†longer.



**Correction**: Oops! I forgot the functional style can be a one-liner with a simple arrow function:

<pre name="4e57" id="4e57" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">const Hello = ({greeting, firstName}) => </pre>

#### 4\. Inconsistency

Function and class components look different. This inconsistency can slow developers down as they shift between the two styles.

*   In classes, you say **this.props**, in functions, you say **props**.
*   In classes, you declare a renderfunction. In functions, you don‚Äôt.
*   In classes, you destructure at the top of render. In functions, you destructure in the function‚Äôs argument list.
*   In classes, you declare default props below the component (or via class properties if you‚Äôre willing to use a [stage-3 feature](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-class-fields/)). In functions, you declare default props using default arguments.

These subtle differences add friction for new devs, and the context switching leads to mistakes for experienced devs too.

#### 5\. Classes Are Familiar to OO Developers

Yes, JavaScript‚Äôs classes are certainly different than Java and C# classes. But anyone working in OO-land on the server is likely to find this simple rule easy to understand:

> ‚ÄúA React component is a class that extends React.Component.‚Äù

Adding a nuanced conversation about how and when to use plain functions adds confusion for OO devs who are already accustomed to being required to use classes for everything. Now I‚Äôm not saying this mindset is healthy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe React community fosters more of a functional mindset. But, one must acknowledge that functional components create mental-model friction for OO devs.

#### 6\. No Performance Benefits, Yet

While the React team has alluded to the chance that functional components will be faster or more efficient in the future, that‚Äôs not the case yet. So one could argue functional components are currently a premature optimization.

And since functional components require conversion to a class to implement today‚Äôs performance tweaks like shouldComponentUpdate and PureComponent, they‚Äôre actually more of a hassle to optimize for performance today.

#### 7\. Yet another¬†decision

Finally, JavaScript developers already have a [ridiculous number of decisions to make](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/you-need-a-javascript-starter-kit-ff12d90ed8c5). Banning functional components eliminates a decision: Always create a class.

### Summary

[I‚Äôm still a fan of functional components](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/8-key-react-component-decisions-cc965db11594). But now I recognize they‚Äôre not necessarily a slam dunk for everyone. So, as usual, consider the tradeoffs. üëç

See other downsides or benefits? Chime in below.

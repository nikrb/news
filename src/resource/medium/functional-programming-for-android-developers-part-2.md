# Functional Programming for Android Developers — Part 2

In the last post, we learned about _Purity_, _Side effects_ and _Ordering._ In this part, let’s talk about _immutability_ and _concurrency_.

If you haven’t read part 1, please read it here:

[**Functional Programming for Android developers — Part 1**

### Immutability

Immutability is the idea that a value once created can never be modified.

Let’s say I have an _Car_ classlike this:

**Java**

<pre name="abb7" id="abb7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public final class Car {  
    private String name;  

    public Car(final String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  

    public void setName(final String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  

    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
}</pre>

**Kotlin**

<pre name="07b4" id="07b4" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">class Car(var name: String?)</pre>

Since it has a setter in Java and is a mutable property in Kotlin, I can modify the name of the car after I’ve constructed it:

**Java**

<pre name="caa8" id="caa8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">Car car = new Car("BMW");  
car.setName("Audi");</pre>

**Kotlin**

<pre name="51d0" id="51d0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">val car = Car("BMW")  
car.name = "Audi"</pre>

This class is _not_ immutable. It can be modified after creation.

Let’s make it immutable. In order to do that in Java, we have to:

*   Make the name variable _final._
*   Remove the setter.
*   Make the class _final_ as well so that another class cannot extend it and modify it’s internals.

**Java**

<pre name="0658" id="0658" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public final class Car {  
    private final String name;  

    public Car(final String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  

    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
}</pre>

In Kotlin, we just have to make the name an immutable value.

**Kotlin**

<pre name="1574" id="1574" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">class Car(val name: String)</pre>

Now if someone needs to create a new car, they need to initialize a new object. No one can modify our car once it’s created. This class is now _immutable_.

But what about the _getName()_ getter in Java or the _name_ accessor in Kotlin? It’s returning our name variable to the outside world right? What if someone were to modify the _name_ value after getting a reference to it from this getter?

In Java, [strings are immutable by default](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552301/immutability-of-strings-in-java). Even if someone got a reference to our _name_ string and were to modify it, they would get a copy of the _name_ string and the original string would remain intact.

But what about things that are not immutable? A list perhaps? Let’s modify the _Car_ class to have a list of people who drive it.

**Java**

<pre name="9041" id="9041" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public final class Car {  
    private final List<String> listOfDrivers;  

    public Car(final List<String> listOfDrivers) {  
        this.listOfDrivers = listOfDrivers;  
    }  

    public List<String> getListOfDrivers() {  
        return listOfDrivers;  
    }  
}</pre>

In this case, someone can use the _getListOfDrivers()_ method to get a reference to our internal list and modify it thus rendering our class _mutable_.

To make it immutable, we must pass a deep copy of the list in the getter that is separate from our list so that the new list can be safely modified by the caller. We must also make a deep copy of the list that is passed in to our constructor so that no one can modify it externally after the car is constructed.

A deep copy means that we copy all the dependent data recursively. For instance, if the list was a list of _Driver_ objects instead of just plain strings, we’d have to copy each of the _Driver_ objects too. Otherwise, we’d be making a new list with references to the original _Driver_ objects which could be mutated. In our class, since the list is composed of immutable strings, we can make a deep copy like this:

**Java**

<pre name="e71d" id="e71d" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public final class Car {  
    private final List<String> listOfDrivers;  

    public Car(final List<String> listOfDrivers) {  
        this.listOfDrivers = deepCopy(listOfDrivers);  
    }  

    public List<String> getListOfDrivers() {  
        return deepCopy(listOfDrivers);  
    }  

    private List<String> deepCopy(List<String> oldList) {  
        List<String> newList = new ArrayList<>();  
        for (String driver : oldList) {  
            newList.add(driver);  
        }  
        return newList;  
    }  
}</pre>

Now this class is truly _immutable_.

In Kotlin, we can simply declare the list immutable in our class definition itself and then it’s safe to use (unless you call it from Java and some other edge cases like that)

**Kotlin**

<pre name="ff3f" id="ff3f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">class Car(val listOfDrivers: List<String>)</pre>

### Concurrency

Okay, so _immutability_ is cool and all but why bother? As we talked about in part 1, pure functions allow us easy concurrency and if an object is immutable, it’s very easy to use in pure functions since you can’t modify it and cause side effects.

Let’s see an example. Suppose that we add a _getNoOfDrivers()_ method in to our _Car_ class in Java and we also make it _mutable_ in both Kotlin and Java by allowing an external caller to modify the number of drivers variable like this:

**Java**

<pre name="59b1" id="59b1" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public class Car {  
    private int noOfDrivers;  

    public Car(final int noOfDrivers) {  
        this.noOfDrivers = noOfDrivers;  
    }  

    public int getNoOfDrivers() {  
        return noOfDrivers;  
    }  

    public void setNoOfDrivers(final int noOfDrivers) {  
        this.noOfDrivers = noOfDrivers;  
    }  
}</pre>

**Kotlin**

<pre name="9e62" id="9e62" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">class Car(var noOfDrivers: Int)</pre>

Suppose we share an instance of this _Car_ class across 2 threads: _Thread_1_ and _Thread_2\. Thread_1_ wants to do some calculation based on the number of drivers so it calls _getNoOfDrivers()_ in Java or accesses the _noOfDrivers_ property in Kotlin_._ Meanwhile _Thread_2_ comes in and modifies the _noOfDrivers_ variable. _Thread_1_ does not know about this change and happily carries on with it’s calculations. These calculations would be wrong since the state of the world has been modified without by _Thread_2_ without _Thread_1_ knowing about them.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the issue:







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PXDu-vgwZ6hmh96lc5TYOg.png)







This is a classic race condition known as the Read-Modify-Write problem. The traditional way to solve this is to use [locks and mutexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion) so that only a single thread can operate on shared data at a time and let go of the lock once the operation is complete (In our case, _Thread_1_ would hold a lock on _Car_ until it completes it’s calculation).

This type of lock-based resource management is notoriously hard to do safely and leads to concurrency bugs that are extremely difficult to analyze. Many programmers have lost their sanity to [deadlocks and livelocks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)

How would immutability fix this you say? Let’s make _Car_ immutable again:

**Java**

<pre name="356f" id="356f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">public final class Car {  
    private final int noOfDrivers;  

    public Car(final int noOfDrivers) {  
        this.noOfDrivers = noOfDrivers;  
    }  

    public int getNoOfDrivers() {  
        return noOfDrivers;  
    }  
}</pre>

**Kotlin**

<pre name="32b8" id="32b8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">class Car(val noOfDrivers: Int)</pre>

Now, _Thread_1_ can carry out it’s calculations without worry since it’s guaranteed that _Thread_2_ cannot modify the car object. If _Thread_2_ wants to modify _Car,_ then it’ll create it’s own copy to do so and _Thread_1_ will be completely unaffected by it. No locks necessary.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*EyBmNH__K0QlOfapgib_rg.png)







Immutability ensures that shared data is thread-safe by default. Things that _should not_ be modified _cannot_ be modified.

#### What If we need to have global modifiable state?

To write real world applications, we need shared modifiable state in many instances. There might a genuine requirement to update _noOfDrivers_ and have it reflect across the system. We’ll deal with situations like that by using state isolation and pushing side effects to the edges of our system when we talk about _functional architectures_ in an upcoming chapter.

### Persistent data structures

Immutable objects may be great, but if we use them without restraint, they will overload the garbage collector and cause performance issues. Functional programming also provides us specialized data structures to use immutability while minimizing object creation. These specialized data structures are known as _Persistent Data Structures._

A persistent data structure always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure.

Let’s say we have the following strings that we want to store in memory: **reborn, rebate, realize, realizes, relief, red, redder.**

We can store them all separately but that would take more memory than we need. If we look closely, we can see that these strings have many characters in common and we could represent them in a single [_trie_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure like this (not all tries are persistent but tries are one of the tools we can use to implement persistent data structures) :



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5_7HbxMEMGRmpPkxlUnIHA.png)

source: [http://merrigrove.blogspot.in/2010/05/dictionary-trie.html](http://merrigrove.blogspot.in/2010/05/dictionary-trie.html)



This is the basic idea behind how persistent data structures work. When a new string is to be added, we simply create a new node and link it in the appropriate place. If an object which is using this structure needs to delete a node, we simply stop referencing it from that object but the actual node is not deleted from memory thus preventing side effects. This ensures that other objects that are referencing this structure can continue to use it.

When no other object is referencing it, we can GC the whole structure to reclaim memory.

Persistent data structures in Java are not a radical idea. [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is a functional language that runs on the JVM and has an entire standard library of persistent data structures. You could directly use the Clojure’s standard lib in Android code but it has significant size and method count. A better alternative I’ve found is a library called [PCollections](https://pcollections.org/). It has [427 methods and 48Kb dex size](http://www.methodscount.com/?lib=org.pcollections%3Apcollections%3A2.1.2) which makes it great for our purposes.

As an example, here’s how we’d create and use a persistent linked list using PCollections:

**Java**

<pre name="78e7" id="78e7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">ConsPStack<String> list = ConsPStack._empty_();  
System._out_.println(list);  // []  

ConsPStack<String> list2 = list.plus("hello");  
System._out_.println(list);  // []  
System._out_.println(list2); // [hello]  

ConsPStack<String> list3 = list2.plus("hi");  
System._out_.println(list);  // []  
System._out_.println(list2); // [hello]  
System._out_.println(list3); // [hi, hello]  

ConsPStack<String> list4 = list3.minus("hello");  
System._out_.println(list);  // []  
System._out_.println(list2); // [hello]  
System._out_.println(list3); // [hi, hello]  
System._out_.println(list4); // [hi]</pre>

As we can see, none of the lists are modified in-place but a new copy is returned every time a modification is required.

PCollections has a bunch of standard persistent data structures implemented for various use cases and is worth exploring. They also play nice with Java’s standard collection library which is quite handy.

Kotlin comes with a standard library that already has immutable collections so if you’re using Kotlin, you’re good to go.

Persistent data structures are a vast subject and this section is only touching the tip of the iceberg. If you are interested in learning more about them, [Chris Okasaki’s Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504) comes highly recommended.

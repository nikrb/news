# I just got my free Hacktoberfest shirt. Here’s a quick way you can get yours.

The design for 2017’s Hacktoberfest shirt







Every October, Digital Ocean and GitHub ship out free Hacktoberfest shirts to thousands of people around the world.

They mailed me one last year. It still looks great after being laundered every week. And I’ve already qualified to get this year’s shirt, too.

In this quick article, I’ll show you how you can get a Hacktoberfest shirt — even if you have never coded before.

The bottom line is this: if you can open 4 pull requests by October 31 — and I’ll walk you through how to do this — you can get your own Hacktoberfest shirt shipped to your door for free.

### Step #1: Register for Hacktoberfest

You need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one yet, you can [create one for free in just a few minutes](https://github.com/join).

Then go to the [Hacktoberfest registration page and follow the instructions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/sign_up/register). It only takes a moment.

### Step #2: Learn how to make a pull request

Pull requests are a way of contributing your code changes to an open source project. They use a tool called Git, which runs on a social coding platform called GitHub.

GitHub is the center of the open source universe, and is home to projects like Linux to jQuery.

It can take months for developers to get good enough to contribute to some of these projects. But the freeCodeCamp community has created an open source project that even absolute beginners can contribute to: [the freeCodeCamp Guide](https://guide.freecodecamp.org).

The freeCodeCamp Guide is full of easy-to-understand explanations of basic technology tools and concepts.

**You can contribute to the freeCodeCamp Guide right in your browser on GitHub.** You don’t need to install anything on your computer. You don’t even need to know a programming language. You just need to choose a topic you’re interested in, research it, and write about it.

Currently there are thousands of topics and sub-topics. Most of these are Wikipedia-style “stubs” with nothing more than a name. You can do some research and help flesh-out these stubs.

Here’s a short gif showing how you can do this:

The steps are:

1.  First, [read the style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides#article-style-guide) so you can understand how these articles are structured.
2.  Explore the [freeCodeCamp Guide folders](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/tree/master/src/pages/) and choose a topic you want to write about.
3.  Open that folder’s index.md file by double-clicking it.
4.  Click the pen symbol in the upper right-hand corner to edit it.
5.  Make your changes to it. You can check out [this basic Markdown cheat-sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you want to see how to add images or videos. You don’t even need to know HTML.
6.  Scroll down and describe your changes in the commit message.
7.  Make sure the “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request” radio button is selected.
8.  Click “Commit Changes.”
9.  On the next page, click “Create Pull Request.”

We will run some automatic tests to make sure your changes didn’t break anything. Then one of our maintainers will give you feedback on your article. Once everything looks good, we’ll merge your pull request.

Note that you can create stubs for new topics you think the freeCodeCamp Guide should cover. Just be sure to put them inside the appropriate folders and subfolders.

Your contribution will automatically be deployed to the freeCodeCamp Guide, where millions of people can read and reference it.

Contributing to the freeCodeCamp guide is a good way to ease into contributing to open source. You can also join our [contributor chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors) to hang out with other contributors and ask questions.

### Step #3: Make 3 more pull requests

You can make three more pull requests to the freeCodeCamp Guide, or whatever open source project you want. Here’s [a more detailed guide to contributing to open source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source), if you’re feeling adventurous.

### Step #4: Check and see whether you’ve qualified

Once you’ve signed up for Hacktoberfest, you can check your progress on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

Beth has opened three pull requests to the freeCodeCamp Guide and will earn her Hacktoberfest 2017 shirt when she opens her next pull request.







### Step #5: Wait for your Hacktoberfest 2017 shirt to arrive in the mail

In past years, shirts have arrived in November or December, depending on how far you live from San Francisco.

The Digital Ocean team should eventually contact you asking for your shirt size and shipping address. (Keep in mind they are shipping 10,000+ shirts so this process will take a while.) And yes, they will ship internationally.

### Frequently asked questions people ask about Hacktoberfest

#### What kinds of pull requests count toward earning the Hacktoberfest shirt?

Any pull request made to a public repo on GitHub will count. The pull request must contain commits you personally made yourself — not automated commits from bots.

#### What if my pull requests aren’t accepted?

Even if your pull requests aren’t accepted, as long as you open at least 4 pull requests, you’ll earn the shirt.

#### What if I don’t make at least four pull requests by midnight October 31?

As long as you registered for Hacktoberfest, you’ll still get some free stickers in the mail. So it’s still worth registering, even if you’re too busy to participate.

#### Are there any in-person Hacktoberfest events I can attend and get help with my pull requests?

There are events all around the world. Here’s [an up-to-date listing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11HlW-LzWMkXDbYV2fC-IuBtTh2zSsNuhvZzujhvxRGA/edit#gid=0).

You can also [attend a freeCodeCamp study group event in your city](https://study-group-directory.freecodecamp.org).

### Celebrate Hacktoberfest with the global open source community

So far this month, we’ve already [merged hundreds of pull requests](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20created%3A%3E%3D2017-10-01%20) on the [freeCodeCamp Guide repository](https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides). And we’re just getting started.

I hope you’ll contribute to the open source community, learn a few new things, and have fun in the process!

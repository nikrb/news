# 7 Ways Streaming Makes you a Better Coder

After coding live on twitch.tv for dozens of hours, I’m convinced that streaming makes you a better coder. Here’s why.

#### 1) Get the benefits of pair programming, but on your own time

Pair programming, the staple of agile development, focuses on working through problems with a partner at your side.

The goal is for one person to take the lead while the other person checks for details and slip-ups that the main person may miss. Think of it as a big picture/small picture work balance.

Streaming sets this up naturally. You will work on the big picture, and the chat will keep an eye on the details.

Why is streaming more convenient than pairing? You don’t need to play the scheduling game with your pair or worry about mismatched dev environments. You can start streaming and let the audience come to you.

#### 2) Get free, immediate help in Twitch chat














One of the most frustrating parts of learning to code is learning where to look for help.

When you stream from the Free Code Camp channel, users of all skill levels tune in. Once you let them know you’re open to their help, it’s like having a free personal coding lesson.

You’ll also get help staying on track — an audience will indirectly keep you on track because you feel accountable for the topic cohesiveness of the stream.

Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses so your viewers can feel comfortable giving you candid feedback.

#### 3) Boost your confidence














Being honest on the stream about things that are difficult for me always inspires encouraging words from the chat.

Most coders struggle with the same things that you do and are happy to share what has worked for them. Hearing from your viewers will remind you that all coders encounter difficulties.

Just like going to the gym, streaming requires initial motivation. But you always walk away feeling happy that you did it.

#### 4) Feel more connected with other coders














Many new coders have taken advantage of local coding events, which are a great way to socialize while you’re learning on your own.

Sometimes, you want some interaction but there aren’t any events in your city, or you don’t feel like leaving the house. Streaming will allow you to connect, work with, and learn from coders from all over the world.

You’re not the only person on earth who’s learning to code, and streaming can be a huge reminder of that.

#### 5) Practice your communication skills














Before you can write good code, you need to articulate your problem and how you plan to solve it.

Streaming gives you a chance to practice talking about your code with fast, low-stakes feedback.

#### 6) Help other coders learn, too














People who tune into your coding stream will range from beginner to expert.

They’ll get exposure to new approaches and see how you go about solving problems.

Watching you will also reinforce the fact that it’s normal to look things up and ask other coders for help.

#### 7) Build teamwork mentality














Most coders work as part of a team.

In case you haven’t heard, [software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). There won’t be a shortage of software development jobs any time soon.

Instead of worrying about competition, focus on helping yourself and others get ready to fill those jobs as soon as possible.

Streaming and interacting with the chat is a perfect way to practice a teamwork mentality while you code.

#### Try streaming on Free Code Camp’s Twitch channel

Dozens of campers from our open source community have improved their coding by streaming on [our Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp).

You should stream on our channel. Don’t worry about your English proficiency or how advanced a coder you are — our audience of nearly 3,000 subscribers is really chill and supportive.

Reach out to me (Briana) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianamarie132) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/brianamarie) and I’ll help you [get set up to stream](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Stream-Your-Coding-Sessions-on-Twitch.tv).

# How to define a Minimum Viable Product

## Moving from a concept to a properly defined MVP

The **Minimum Viable Product**, although a properly defined term, means different things to different people. In fact, it is one of the most misused terms in the technology domain: it is often poorly referenced to describe a _prototype_, a _demo_ or even _the first deliverable_ of a project.

> “In product development, the minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development” — [Minimum_viable_product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

### A strategy for defining a proper, real MVP

Assuming you have this great idea — a concept you believe is good enough to further analyze as a product — you need a method to start defining the _product_ and more specifically, the subset of the product features that can serve your objectives with the minimum cost and risk. Key stages in this process are:

#### **Identify your users**

**Set the context** — think of the _problem_, the _situation_, the _opportunity_; think of what is already available in the market dealing with the same problem; identify and name the types of users involved and how they interact. Document your _users_, their _needs_, the _problems_ they are experiencing, their _expectations_, and the _best-possible experience_ they could have in your context.

#### **Think as a user (for each class of users identified)**

The **Minimum** in the **MVP** implies that _you already have the big picture_, you have **the product vision!** A common mistake is when the team ‘easily’ identifies a set of ‘obvious’ use cases as the MVP — without a clear product vision and the big picture.

Having the big picture, the product vision, you need to apply a process to identify the smallest subset of functionality that serves a very specific goal: **to satisfy your users** while enabling critical user insights and feedback which can significantly improve the next iteration in your product development plan.

The big picture can be expressed as the super-set of user stories across all the classes of users identified. It’s a good idea to create a large set of epic stories: iterate across all identified users and try to define user stories covering their needs and expected benefit/ gains.

Use a compact format as the one proposed in Scrum _as a <user> I want to <be able to perform an activity> so that <describe the gain>_. You don’t have to worry about priorities at this stage. A good idea would be to name each story/ assign a compact title for easier classification and organization.

As soon as you have your product feature super-set — the big picture — you need to review it to ensure that it really defines a product (the P of the MVP): search for _continuity_, _homogeneity_ and _complementarity_ among your user stories.

As a result of this process, you may realize that more than one related products are referenced in your backlog and need to be separated. Or you may realize that there are significant gaps that need to be filled.

Again, think as a user, _use empathy to identify interactions, scenarios and stories_ that need to be included.

You need to also **gather feedback** so you can try to **validate your stories** and the product through expert advice, user interviews, formal or informal surveys or public domain references (for instance any reliable public domain statistics that can in-validate your assumptions).

#### **Think as an entrepreneur**

Thinking as a user is great — you can be creative and forget, for a moment, about real-world challenges such as technical and financial constraints: your objective is to compile the product super-set of user stories to satisfy — or to even to excite — all the different types of your users.

Now it’s time to think as an entrepreneur: you need to start considering and documenting _implementation costs_, _priorities_, _strategic advantages_ and _differentiators against competition_.

You need to estimate the development cost of each user story and also to quantify the expected value for the user along with the expected impact on the business: **your business**.

The logic to identify the **_right minimum subset_** can be complex — requiring estimates of all the above at the user-story level; for each user story (or Epic) you need to have at least the following:

1\. The complexity / cost associated / feasibility

2\. The expected value for the user

Estimates of the above dimensions could be on a numerical or ordinal scale. As soon as you have those estimations you can then rank your stories and also plot them in a simple chart against _complexity_ and _expected value for the user_.

At this point you can start prioritising **high-value, low-cost stories** over _lower value, costly_ ones. Be aware though of those natural, _strong dependencies between_ product features.

In many cases there are technical or procedural dependencies requiring certain features to be implemented first although their cost is high and the expected user value low. These dependencies need to be identified and possibly visualized in the user stories mapping.

Having the above for each of the features (user stories) of your product allows you to **define your MVP** as:

> “… the minimum set of features (stories) ensuring a good-enough product experience driving increased user engagement that can secure the next product development cycle”

You can sort your entire product backlog by _dependency sequence_ (start with foundation), then by the _value for the user_ in descending order and then by _complexity_ and _feasibility_ in ascending.

You can also combine budget constraints, team’s velocity and go-to-market strategy makes it ‘easy’ to identify the red-line of your to-be-proved Viable MP.

The above can be easily applied on a well-understood concept and documented in the form of a properly structured product backlog.

In reality though this will be just a draft definition of an MVP. What is needed in an ideal scenario is feedback and validation of the features by real users via prototyping, focus groups, market research, competition analysis and related methods.

The more input from real users the more confident you can be that your product concept has all it takes to become Viable (which also assumes a great _execution_/ _implementation_/ _launch_).

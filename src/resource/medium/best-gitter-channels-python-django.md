It is also one of the most popular languages for those learning to code.The name “Python” is reported to come from Monty Python’s Flying Circus!

Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. Django is an extremely widely used framework, and part of what makes is so powerful is the ability to be extended with ‘app’ plugins, as well as the availability of various packages.

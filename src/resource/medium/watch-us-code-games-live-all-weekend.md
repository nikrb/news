With technologies like WebGL, you can code 3D games that run right in a browser.

We’re streaming a nonstop game development marathon [this weekend on our Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp).  

JavaScript is a powerful and versatile technology. It’s popular for web development, mobile development, Internet of Things, data visualization, and of course, gaming.

This weekend, our campers will build a variety of games using JavaScript-based technologies.  

The show will kick off Friday at 5 p.m. EST on our [Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp), and continue through Sunday night.

The World’s Biggest Pac-Man takes the classic game to it’s extremes with HTML5.



JavaScript games will run on any device with a browser, and often don’t require downloading, so they are ideal for indie game developers. With new technologies like [WebAssembly](http://www.quora.com/What-does-WebAssembly-mean-for-those-who-are-currently-learning-web-development/answer/Quincy-Larson), these browser-based games may soon rival Xbox and Playstation games in graphics and gameplay.

The 2048 puzzle game, built by one person over a single weekend, took the internet by storm in 2014.



Many developers in our community enjoy building video games. While game development jobs are harder to come by than web development jobs, everyone can agree that game development is a lot of fun.

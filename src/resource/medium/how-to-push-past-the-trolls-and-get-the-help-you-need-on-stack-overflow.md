# How to push past the trolls and get the help you need on Stack Overflow

When you’re new to coding, Stack Overflow can be a scary place. It’s an amazing resource for newbies. But it’s also a place where bullies troll for new victims.

With the hundreds of thousands of unfilled programming jobs out there, and the need for more diversity in the field, you’d think that experienced programmers would be eager to help newbies. And generally, they are.

But there’s also a vocal minority of people who will respond to your questions with snark or responses like “Read the Freaking Manual (RTFM)”. They may flag your question as a duplicate without taking time to read it, or take any number of other passive-aggressive actions.

You’ll need to push past all this in your quest for the answers you seek.

I was a high school teacher, so there is very little that some anonymous person online can say to me that will keep me from getting answers to my questions.

Still, it took me some time to add Stack Overflow to my toolbox. This was not out of fear of trolls. It was because I wasn’t yet sure of how to ask the right questions.

### How to ask the right questions

Here are some beginner steps for newbies to use to harness the power of Stack Overflow in leveling up their learning. All examples are my own :-)

#### Research your question online before posting it.

Wording is everything.

Read this article for more details: [Homework Center: Finding Information on the Internet: Using Search Engines](https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/homework-center-finding-information-internet-using-search-engines)

#### Provide ALL relevant information

This including links to other resources you’ve looked at in researching your question.

#### Don’t include screenshots of your codebase.

Copy and paste the actual code into the text box (use the { } ).

Those who are wanting to help you will use your code to try an replicate your error or issue.

This is only a portion of the profile.rb. Too wide to include in image

#### Learn to use the formatting tools.

How do I format my code blocks?



For more details on how to do this, read [How do I format my code blocks?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22186/how-do-i-format-my-code-blocks)

#### Use tags.

They help to make sure that the right group of people with the expertise you are seeking see your question.

#### If you receive an answer that you don’t understand, ask politely for additional clarity.

For example: “Hello (person’s name) I’m new and I don’t understand your answer. Would it be possible for you to provide additional information for clarity? Thank you.”

For more details, check out [How to ask a good question?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and [Discourage screenshots of code and/or errors](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/303812/discourage-screenshots-of-code-and-or-errors).

#### If you receive a response that seems harsh, politely remind them that you are new and still learning.

For example: “Thank you (person’s name), I’m new and it would be helpful if you explained what’s wrong with my question and the steps I can take to ensure that I don’t make this mistake again.”

#### If one or more of the answers you receive helped you with your issue use the arrows next to that answer to upvote it.

Stack Overflow has a points system. It’s important to those who have taken the time to help you, so it should be important to you.

I’d like to end this post with two very good examples of the process outlined above: [How to create more than one index page in RoR](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34259517/how-to-create-more-than-one-index-page-in-ror) and [Installing the jQuery.AreYouSure?

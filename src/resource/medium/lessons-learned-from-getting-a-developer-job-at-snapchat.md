Here are three links worth your time:

1.  I just got a developer job at Snapchat. Here’s what I learned and how it can help you with your job search ([15 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lV3c01))
2.  How to build animated microinteractions in React ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lSNyFL))
3.  It’s time to give TypeScript another chance ([6 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kQYsYx))

Bonus: I interviewed Preethi Kasireddy about her transition from venture capitalist to software engineer, and her new functional programming course ([22 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2lept98))

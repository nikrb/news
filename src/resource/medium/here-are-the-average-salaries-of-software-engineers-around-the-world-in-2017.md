You can read the full analysis here ([5 minute read](http://hrd.cm/2kQnac1))

And here are two other links worth your time:

1.  I interviewed data scientist Amber Thomas about her recent data visualization project that made international news ([30 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2kXgiMC))
2.  Why are all Windows drivers dated June 21, 2006? Don’t they ever update drivers? ([2 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kbxIFW))

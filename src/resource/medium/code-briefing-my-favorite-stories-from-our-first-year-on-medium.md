# Code Briefing: My favorite stories from our first year on Medium

Over the past 12 months, I’ve edited nearly 500 stories written by hundreds of developers. Here are my personal favorites, which are definitely worth your time:

1.  Angular 2 versus React: There Will Be Blood: [10 minute read](http://bit.ly/2ejsqkj)
2.  Finding Time to Become a Better Developer: [8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2e9PCmj)
3.  Being a Developer After 40: [19 minute read](http://bit.ly/2dtnbAB)

Bonus: Our community designed this low-effort Halloween costume. [Pick one up](https://www.freecodecamp.com/shop) before Tuesday — in mens and fitted women’s sizes.

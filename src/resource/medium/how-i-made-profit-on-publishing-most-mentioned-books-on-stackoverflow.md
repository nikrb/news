# How my side project satisfied my curiosity — and made me $3,000

I was curious what books were most commonly recommended on Stack Overflow. So I analyzed a database dump, counted the mentions, then built a website for exploring the data. (You can read about this entire process step-by-step [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-analyzed-every-book-ever-mentioned-on-stack-overflow-here-are-the-most-popular-ones-eee0891f1786#.f3zmngrka).)

On February 1st I launched [dev-books.com](http://www.dev-books.com). Over the next few days, the website got more than 100,000 visits.

Many of these visitors got in touch with me with questions regarding my profit from this project. So — as promised — I’m publishing this full report from Google Analytics and Amazon, along with my story. :)

### How this website makes money

For this project, I chose the [Amazon Affiliate Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/), since Amazon is the biggest book store I know of. Account registration was pretty straight forward, so I received my affiliate tag to use in links on my website in less than an hour.

### Cold start

After everything was up and running, I’ve posted link to [dev-books.com](http://www.dev-books.com) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), trying to attract some developers’ attention to my project.

Unfortunately, it didn’t bring in the wide audience I was hoping for. But I started to get some feedback, fixed some bugs, and got suggestions on how to promote my project.

At the end of the day, I received message from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) teacher [Quincy Larson](https://medium.com/@quincylarson) suggesting I write a story about my project and how I built it, to make it more accessible to people.

### The Breakthrough

Reading [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-published-in-the-freecodecamp-medium-publication-9b342a22400e) article by Quincy Larson, I found a very useful tool for making the headline called [Headline Analyzer](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer). I tried the headline I used for my posts, and got quite low rating, so I started to make a better headline to repost my website.

Pretty soon I scored 65 points and posted fresh headline to Hacker News and Reddit.

This time, according to Google Analytics, I had more than 750 concurrent visitors for several hours straight while my post on Hacker News was on top. Having said that, I probably lost some audience due to my web server failure (which I also wrote about [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-analyzed-every-book-ever-mentioned-on-stack-overflow-here-are-the-most-popular-ones-eee0891f1786#.uko51rk42)).

The next day, I found out that [dev-books.com](http://www.dev-books.com) had more than 5,000 shares on Facebook (which you can be seen [here](https://graph.facebook.com/?id=http://dev-books.com)), was posted to [lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com), as well as translated and posted to many other resources all over the world.

Google Analytics audience overview for February 2017,







### Geolocation

The next day, I created a geolocation report from Google Analytics and found out that I was getting quite a bit of traffic from Asia and Europe — particularly Russia.

Making my Asian and European visitors waiting for their orders from US was impolite, so I created affiliate accounts at amazon.co.uk, amazon.de and amazon.fr.

For sure, I’ve lost some orders because of this issue.

That same night my visitors started getting links to their closest store.

### The most interesting part

In the pictures below, you can see statistics from Amazon.com for the month of February 2017\. From the European cluster of Amazon in total I got just a bit more than $250\. Could it be more if I have done geolocation based links from the very beginning? For sure.

$490 on February 9th







And here’s my final earnings for February: $2,534.40.

Summary for February 2017



Am I happy with this result? Absolutely.

[Dev-books.com](http://www.dev-books.com) still operates, and keeps bringing in some orders, so it has already earned more than $3000 in the month and a half since I launched it.

How would you rate my result? Could it be much higher? I’d be happy to get your feedback/tips/stories in the comments below, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VLPLabs), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VLP-Labs-727090070789985/).

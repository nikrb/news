When your code isn’t working and you don’t know why:














When you’re in the zone and someone tries to talk to you:














When you have no idea what other coders are talking about, but want to still seem cool:














The next day at work after you stayed up way too late working on a project:














When someone asks about something you know nothing about:














When someone you don’t know that well asks if you can fix their computer problem:














Trying to maintain spaghetti code:














When someone says “You don’t _look_ like a programmer!”:














When your code is functioning as expected:














When your code is successfully deployed:














When you fulfilled all of the client’s user stories…and then they change the user stories:














When you try out a new IDE:














When your CSS works exactly how you want it to:














When new Free Code Camp challenges come out:














When you were sure you’d pushed to your fav VCS before your computer died, but you were wrong:














When you forgot to eat while you were coding for all those hours:














When someone says their preferred browser is internet explorer:














When you don’t understand the errors your code is getting:














When you’re coding in public and you want the world to understand your frustration:














When you look back at your own code from long ago that you’re not super proud of:














When you know how to solve your team’s problem:














When you’re trying to use business lingo to make a meeting go faster:














When you aren’t sure how, but you know that last bit of code just broke everything. EVERYTHING.














When people ask how you like ES6:














When you spend hours fixing something that turned out to be super simple:














When you realize that you’ll never run out of problems to solve with code…and you love it:

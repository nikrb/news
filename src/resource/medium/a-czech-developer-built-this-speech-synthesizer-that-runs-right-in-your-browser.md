2.  Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer spent years and $10 million to put together a massive open dataset about US government spending, which he launched this morning ([6 minute read](http://nyti.ms/2nZEPmI))
3.  Going from “What is Blockchain?” to building a blockchain, in less than an hour ([7 minute read](http://bit.ly/2pydh54))

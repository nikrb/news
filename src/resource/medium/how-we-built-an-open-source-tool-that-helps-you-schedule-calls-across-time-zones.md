# Meeting for Good: How Campers Built an Open Source Tool to Solve Time¬†Zones







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TOftw-TQsde7kSNHid4mGw.png)







Today, I‚Äôm thrilled to announce a free tool that solves the two biggest problems with scheduling meetings: **time zones** and **availability**.

It‚Äôs called [Meeting for Good](https://meeting.freecodecamp.com), and here‚Äôs a quick demo of it in action:









<iframe data-width="640" data-height="480" width="980" height="735" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/ecf14c283c0dfa58f414a3ab7da6aa57?postId=f8e6bce8455d" data-media-id="ecf14c283c0dfa58f414a3ab7da6aa57" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLVZbUDzx1a0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>









A growing percentage of people are working remotely. Collaborating with people around the globe is becoming the norm, rather than the exception. But our tools for collaborating haven‚Äôt quite caught up.

I should know‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas the nonprofit guy at freeCodeCamp and creator of [Open Source for Good](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/open-source-for-good-1a0ea9f32d5a), I‚Äôve spent the past two and a half years organizing hundreds of developers around the world to come together and code pro bono for nonprofits.

Together, our teams build free and open source software. Separately, we all have our own obligations. Most of us work, raise families, go to school, serve in our country‚Äôs military, or some combination of the above.

We‚Äôre busy in different ways, and at different times.

And because freeCodeCamp is a global community, we almost never live in the same time zone.

So scheduling a call with, say, five people in five different countries is easier said than done.

Although there are a few web-based tools that try to help people schedule meetings, we‚Äôve yet to find one that‚Äôs easy to use, supports multiple timezones, and helps people find common availability.

Here‚Äôs a good example of a bad solution:

Oh cool, let me go scrounging for a pen while you hold my event¬†hostage.







Yeah, not great.

We set out to build this tool with one simple goal: **to help people effortlessly schedule calls across multiple timezones.**

And that‚Äôs exactly what we did. It‚Äôs called Meeting for Good. We‚Äôve been using it for months and it‚Äôs getting more polished every day. You‚Äôre welcome to use it too.

We‚Äôre [hosting it for free, with no ads](https://meeting.freecodecamp.com). And of course it‚Äôs also [open source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/meeting-for-good/).

#### How exactly does Meeting for Good¬†work?

1.  **Create an event,** with a range of possible dates and times:

2\. **Enter your availability,** using simple click and drag:

3\. **Invite others,** usingemail, the event‚Äôs custom URL, or recent invitees:

That‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs ridiculously simple.

As participants join and add their own availabilities, you‚Äôll see the event update itself with times that work for everyone **in your timezone**.

Four people, four timezones. Converted automatically to¬†mine.



If you want more detail on the times where there‚Äôs overlap, you can click ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù and look over the heat map:

Shout out to the person available on Sunday nights. It wasn‚Äôt me. I have¬†HBO.







And your dashboard will let you see an overview of all of your upcoming events at a glance.

We‚Äôre really proud of the app so far, and we‚Äôre nowhere near finished.

We‚Äôd love to know what you think too, so please leave a comment with your feedback.

Special thanks go to [JP (in Sao Paulo)](https://github.com/jrogatis), [Aniruddh (in Singapore)](https://github.com/awesomeaniruddh), [Bob (in California)](https://github.com/anischyros), and [Akira (in New Caledonia)](https://github.com/AkiraLaine) for their volunteer contributions in building Meeting for Good.

We‚Äôve also got more new software projects to unveil this summer, and a new directory on the way to display all of our Open Source for Good projects in one place.

Stay tuned and happy coding!

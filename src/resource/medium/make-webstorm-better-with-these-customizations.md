# Make WebStorm better with these customizations

In this blog post I will show how to make WebStorm look awesome, make it faster, and improve the dev ergonomics.

#### Make WebStorm LookÂ Awesome

If you are asking yourself why is my WebStorm UI looks so much cooler than the default UI, the answer is that I customized it.

To get the same look, do the following:

*   Hide the toolbar and tool buttons. WebStorm is a keyboard-friendly environment, so there is absolutely no reason to have any buttons taking valuable real estate.
*   [Install the Material UI theme plugin.](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) It looks gorgeous.
*   Donâ€™t settle for the default font. Use the one you really like. (e.g., I use [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/)).

#### Make WebStormÂ Fast

My WebStorm does not just look better, **it is faster as well**. If you feel the need for speed, do the following:

Open:

<pre name="2960" id="2960" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">/Applications/WebStorm.app/Contents/bin</pre>

Open the idea.properties configuration file, and enable [the experimental zero-latency mode](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2015/08/experimental-zero-latency-typing-in-intellij-idea-15-eap/) by adding the following line:

<pre name="d91f" id="d91f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">editor.zero.latency.typing=true</pre>

If you even felt that WebStorm is laggy comparing to text editors, the zero-latency mode will fix this.

Next, open webstorm.vmoptions. Bump up the max heap size to at least 3 gigabytes. Our dev machines have so much memoryâ€Šâ€”â€Šmight as well use it!

#### Secret Weapon:Â AceJump

Finally, do yourself a favor and install the Ace Jump plugin. With it you can move your cursor anywhere on the screen with just two keystrokes. So no more â€œdown down down down down right right right rightâ€™. To see it in action, [watch this video by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK8eM50DsAY) [John Lindquist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKW92i7iQFuNILqQOUOCrFw)[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK8eM50DsAY)

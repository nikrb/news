# The 12 YouTube videos new developers mention the most







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2rK6gBMkTSyTEYZ6YHRrlQ.jpeg)

A still from Shia LaBeouf’s motivational video, one of the most commonly shared videos in freeCodeCamp’s chatrooms.







The freeCodeCamp community generates gigabytes of data each week. One of the most active parts of the community is the chat room system. Thousands of people hang out there, chat about technology, and help each other improve their code skills.

I frequently ask questions about the data. This week, I was curious which YouTube videos people found to be the most relevant to their studies. So I analyzed the multi-gigabyte chat history from [freeCodeCamp’s main chatroom](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp).

Out of the thousands of YouTube videos mentioned, here are the 12 most-commonly mentioned ones.

#### What the heck is the event loop anyway?





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/a661a28c8cc4ab11cdfc9f9487ebd139?postId=f2d1fce337ca" data-media-id="a661a28c8cc4ab11cdfc9f9487ebd139" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8aGhZQkoFbQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





This was a presentation by Philip Roberts at JSConf EU in 2014\. The event loop is important to how Node.js works.

To explain the event loop, Philip goes through other essential concepts like callbacks, and asynchronous programming. He jams a ton of insight into an enjoyable 26 minute conference talk.

#### Engineering Truth’s How to teach yourself to code





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/89432b3fb9ee91d7198c4f0e3c6d7f21?postId=f2d1fce337ca" data-media-id="89432b3fb9ee91d7198c4f0e3c6d7f21" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqZKvZzRynLE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





Engineered Truth host Matt Tran interviews freeCodeCamp’s [Quincy Larson](https://medium.com/@quincylarson), asking him for about tips for new coders.

A lot of new coders first heard about freeCodeCamp through this 20-minute video, which has been viewed half a million times.

Another interview Matt Tran conducted with Quincy on the same afternoon — which is also frequently shared in our chat rooms — is [Computer science vs Self-taught vs Coding Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FioceDs7JA).

#### /Reg(exp){2}lained/: Demystifying Regular Expressions





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/a3d9b7098579a7285bd8d811eee99e7f?postId=f2d1fce337ca" data-media-id="a3d9b7098579a7285bd8d811eee99e7f" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FEkluES9Rvak%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





This 48-minutes talk by [Lea Verou](https://medium.com/@leaverou) comes from O’Reilly's 2012 Fluent Conference.

It’s a good summary of what Regular Expressions are, how they work, where to apply them, some very common errors made by new adopters, and tricks that people tend to forget or ignore.

#### Semicolons cannot save you!

This 2-hour-long tutorial uses examples to introduce JavaScript concepts, and how to manipulate the DOM. Derek provides an index in the description of the video so you can jump to specific segments that interest you.

Note that he recorded this in 2015, so it doesn’t include the latest ES6 improvements to JavaScript.

#### O’Reilly’s Keeping Track of This in JavaScript

#### Write in C





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/fb93f96231c6cde6ce404c4aca1eb69e?postId=f2d1fce337ca" data-media-id="fb93f96231c6cde6ce404c4aca1eb69e" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1S1fISh-pag%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





A parodical lyric with the music of Beatles' "Let it be". The parody seems to have been sung for the first time during the 90's when C started to become the language of preference by computer scientists. Authorship is unknown but a version was brought forward by Albert Veli. Sing along!

In case you’re wondering, all the data was obtained from freeCodeCamp’s [main Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp) between June 2016 and March 2017\. I ran a Python script to evaluate the data, then rated the observed YouTube links based on the number of mentions as well as how recent the mentions were. I made the final selection based on relevance.

Again, this list just scratches the surface. freeCodeCamp’s community references hundreds of YouTube videos every day.

I also invite you to check out the excellent content that is available in [the freeCodeCamp youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

Thanks for reading, and happy coding!

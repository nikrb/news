# The best free online university courses for learning a new world language







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gOfBY31x1Zb_tLzVoJkjaQ.jpeg)







Up until a few years ago, language classes cost hundreds of dollars, and came on CDs or DVDs. But now you can now learn English, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and other languages — from top universities online, for free.

There are a ton of language learning apps out there, but these Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) go one step further: they teach you language in the context of history and business culture.

To get a sense of what I’m talking about, take a look at the intro video for edX’s [Mandarin Chinese for Business](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/6611/edx-mx801x-mandarin-chinese-for-business?utm_campaign=language_learning_moocs&utm_source=moocreport) course:

_Mandarin Chinese for Business_







At Class Central, we’ve curated a collection of 30+ MOOCs that teach a variety of languages.

I recommend edX’s [Tsinghua Chinese: Start Talking with 1.3 Billion People](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/5426/edx-tm01x-tsinghua-chinese-start-talking-with-1-3-billion-people?utm_campaign=language_learning_moocs&utm_source=moocreport) and FutureLearn’s [Introduction to Dutch](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/3014/futurelearn-introduction-to-dutch?utm_campaign=language_learning_moocs&utm_source=moocreport). Both these courses are highly rated and, and made our list of the [Top 50 MOOCs of all time](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-data-dont-lie-here-are-the-50-best-free-online-university-courses-of-all-time-b2d9a64edfac#.ebml0r7j6).

Note that some of these courses are self-paced, and others operate on a fixed schedule. Don’t worry if you don’t have time to participate in the current session — another one will probably start in a few months.

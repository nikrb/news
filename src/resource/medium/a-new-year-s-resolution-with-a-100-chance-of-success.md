# A New Year’s Resolution with a 100% Chance of Success

We all make New Year’s resolutions with the best of intentions.

Like many of you, I’m guilty of paying for twelve months of a gym membership, only to actually go work out for two of them.

This past year, I resolved to read for one hour each night before bedtime. But by March, as the nonprofit guy for Free Code Camp, I was already managing 13 nonprofit projects.

Due to the international nature of these projects, many of them involved meetings that would run past midnight. I often found myself too exhausted to read more than a page or two once I finally hit the sack. And just like that, my resolution was dead in the water.

It’s easy to make excuses.

It’s not just me, though. [One study](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-fast-youll-abandon-your-new-years-resolutions/) showed that by June, only 46% of people were still on track with their New Year’s resolutions.

That’s why I’ve come up with a way for you and I to succeed this year —** even if we’re done with our resolutions by June.**

It’s simple: this New Year’s Eve, join [Commit](http://www.freecodecamp.com/commit). This means pledging a monthly donation to a nonprofit until you’ve earned a certification at Free Code Camp.

By pledging to a nonprofit, your coding efforts will help other people learn to code, too.







It’s a win-win kind of resolution.

If you don’t earn your certification by the end of 2016, you’ll still have donated twelve times to a nonprofit that needs your help.

That’s a New Year’s resolution with a 100% chance of success.

Join more than 1,000 people who’ve pledged to a nonprofit while earning a certification in 2016\. [Commit for 2016 here](http://www.freecodecamp.com/commit).

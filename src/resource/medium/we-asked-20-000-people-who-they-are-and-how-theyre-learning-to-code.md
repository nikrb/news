New coders at a the freeCodeCamp Busan studyÂ group



More than 20,000 people responded to our 2017 New Coder Survey, granting researchers an unprecedented glimpse into how adults are learning to code.

Weâ€™ve released the entire dataset of participantsâ€™ individual responses to more than 50 questionsâ€Šâ€”â€Šunder the Open Data Common Licenseâ€Šâ€”â€Šon a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).

In the months that follow, dozens of data scientists will pore over the data and discover all kinds of insights about people who are learning to code.

For now, Iâ€™m going to give you a high-level idea of who these new coders are, how theyâ€™re learning, and what their goals are.

### Who participated?

More than 20,000 new coders responded to this survey. These are people who have been coding for less than 5 years.

Here are some basic facts about them:

*   **62%** of them live outside the US
*   their average age is **28 years old**
*   **19%** are women
*   Theyâ€™ve been coding for an average of **21 months**
*   **25%** have already landed their first developer job

### Learner goals and approaches

#### 40% of them would like to either freelance or start their own business.

#### Most of them are interested in working as web developers, but are also interested in a wide variety of developer specializations.

#### Of the respondents who arenâ€™t yet working as developers, 63% plan to start applying for jobs in the next 12Â months.

### Demographics and Socioeconomics

#### Women are still under-represented among newÂ coders.

# An open source search engine that will help you learn pretty much anything

A team of developers just launched an open source search engine that will show you how to learn pretty much anything. It works by clustering resources into “mind maps.”

Here’s part of their mind map for [web development](https://fcc.im/2s3KiaD):

Their web development map



They have mind maps with resources for learning a wide range of subjects and skills, such as [philosophy](https://learn-anything.xyz/philosophy):

Some of their mind maps are more fleshed-out than others, but all of them are under development by the open source community.

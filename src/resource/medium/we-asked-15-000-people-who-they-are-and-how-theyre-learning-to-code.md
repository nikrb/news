More than 15,000 people responded to the 2016 New Coder Survey, granting researchers an unprecedented glimpse into how adults are learning to code.

Weâ€™ve released the entire dataset of participantsâ€™ individual responses to all 48 questionsâ€Šâ€”â€Šunder the Open Data Common Licenseâ€Šâ€”â€Šon a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey).

In the coming weeks, weâ€™ll publish a website filled with interactive visualizations of these data, answering dozens of questions like:

*   How does the population density of a city affect attendance of coding events?
*   How does desire to work remotely affect getting a first developer job?
*   How does prior military service affect salary at a first developer job, country-by-country?

In the meantime, here are a few high-level statistics from the 2016 New Coder Survey results to tide you over.

#### Who participated?

CodeNewbie and Free Code Camp [designed the survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-just-launched-the-biggest-ever-survey-of-people-learning-to-code-cac81dadf1ea#.chm9tyigi), and dozens of coding-related organizations publicized it to their members.

Of the **15,655** people who responded to the survey:

*   **21%** are women
*   their median age is **27** years old
*   they started programming an average of **11** months ago
*   **28%** have already landed their first developer job

### Learner goals and approaches

#### 40% want to either freelance or start their own business.

#### A vast majority are interested in working as web developers, as opposed to other developer roles.

#### If they have a home mortgage, they owe an average ofÂ $189k.

#### If they have student loans, they owe an average ofÂ $34k.

#### 12% donâ€™t yet have high speed internet atÂ home.

#### And 2% are currently receiving disability benefits from their government.

#### These are the people who are learning to code. You can see why free, self-paced learning resources are important.

### Whatâ€™s next?

Weâ€™ve [cleaned and normalized](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/tree/master/clean-data) all 15,655 records. Our community is using these to build data visualizations that answer a range of different questions.

If you have a question about people who are learning to code, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/new) and weâ€™ll see if we can build an interactive visualization that answers it.

If youâ€™re interested in analyzing these data and/or building some visualizations, [join our Data Science chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience) and introduce yourself.

# Tips for Writing Medium Posts that Other Developers will Actually¬†Read

This weekend we launched our open source community‚Äôs [Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/). More than 200 developers immediately signed up as writers. With a bit of elbow grease, they‚Äôll be sharing their coding insights with thousands of their peers, and you can too.

We‚Äôll publish as many of your high quality articles as we can.

Here are some tips for writing content that will resonate with other developers:

#### Read through articles that we‚Äôve already published. Try to write about things that no one has covered¬†yet.

#### [Seven minutes](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b#.p8jwm4wpf) seems to be the optimal Medium post length. But don‚Äôt water-down your post to get¬†there.

#### Good writing takes time. Keep rereading and reworking your post until you think it‚Äôs perfect. Always read it one last time before you¬†publish.

#### Autobiographical posts are only interesting to other people if they offer useful, non-obvious takeaways. Try to teach your readers something.

#### When you write a technical article, your goal shouldn‚Äôt just be to look smart‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit should be to inform and to be understood.

#### Avoid intimidating readers with a ‚Äúwall of text‚Äù. Keep your paragraphs between 1‚Äì4 sentences, and break them up with headings and¬†images.

#### Imagine that Lisa‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe progressive, humanist, forever adolescent Simpsons character‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill read everything you publish. Don‚Äôt publish anything that would make Lisa disappointed in¬†you.

#### Share your Coding¬†Insights

You most definitely should contribute to [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)‚Äôs Medium publication. Here‚Äôs how to do so, in 3 easy steps (and one harder one):

1.  Create a Medium account.
2.  Add a headshot and bio.
3.  Send an email to [team@freecodecamp.com](mailto:team@freecodecamp.com) with your username, requesting to become a writer for our publication.
4.  Write awesome posts. Submit them to us. We‚Äôll review them and potentially publish them.

We get a lot of submissions. If we don‚Äôt publish yours immediately, [message me in Gitter](https://gitter.im/quincylarson). I‚Äôll give you the status of your submission and quick feedback.

Happy writing about coding!

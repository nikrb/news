**Nick Caldwell, VP of Engineering at¬†Reddit**







Reddit‚Äôs VP of Engineering, [Nick Caldwell](https://breakingintostartups.com/68-nick-caldwell-vp-engineering-reddit), recently sat down with the [Breaking Into Startups Crew](https://breakingintostartups.com/) to talk about leadership, company culture, machine learning, time management, and more.

For those who don‚Äôt know how awesome [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is, it‚Äôs an online forum with 1.1 million active communities. These communities consist of discussion boards on just about every topic imaginable from [‚Äúold ladies baking pies](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldLadiesBakingPies/)‚Äù and ‚Äú[animals being jerks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingJerks/)‚Äù to ‚Äú[everything science](https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/)‚Äù and ‚Äú[fashion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashion/)‚Äù.

Reddit is the 4th most popular website in the United States and the 7th most popular website in the world. Most notably, Reddit has users in the hundreds of millions which means that its software problems are pretty unique.

For example, Reddit recently attempted to ‚Äúbetter communicate the scale of Reddit‚Äù to their users by [building a system](https://redditblog.com/2017/05/24/view-counting-at-reddit/) that shows the number of views a post received rather than just the upvotes.

Some posts receive views in the millions, which means accurately counting views is really tricky. Reddit has to not only maintain an exact count in real time, but also keep track of whether or not a specific user has visited the post before.

For posts with views in the millions it would be very taxing on memory and CPU to store millions of user IDs in a set, then check this set every time there‚Äôs a new view. Reddit engineers were able to determine that a [HyperLogLog](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) (HLL)-based counting approach would require 0.15% of the memory that storing millions of user IDs would require.

These are the interesting types of problems that Reddit engineers face as the business and its platform continues to grow.

Here‚Äôs another example of the role Reddit‚Äôs size plays in the work that its engineers do. Reddit recently created profile pages using a new frontend stack. They decided that during their beta period users would be able to opt into the new profile experience. This meant figuring out how to route requests across different stacks, allowing some users to be routed to the original profile page and others to be routed to the new profile page.

Reddit‚Äôs engineers discovered that using custom [VCL in Fastly](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl/guide-to-vcl) allowed them to make this happen. As of August 2017 they were able to [‚Äúdynamically route 75,000 profiles of users‚Äù](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/04/dynamically-routing-requests-across-different-stacks-with-vcl/) during the beta (learn more about Reddit‚Äôs new front-end stack [here](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/)).

### Meet Nick, developer turned VP of Engineering

Nick Caldwell‚Äôs [Full Interview with Breaking Into Startups Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/breakingintostartups/nick-caldwell-vp-of-engineering-at-reddit)¬†üéß



Nick Caldwell manages one hundred engineers who solve complex problems like these every day. So how did Nick become VP of Engineering at Reddit? His story starts in childhood.

Nick‚Äôs parents, a public defender and a schoolteacher, exposed Nick to ideas, books, and computer technology, but most interestingly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe knowledge that there were more possibilities out there than what he could see in his immediate environment.

When Nick developed an interest in computers, his dad got him a book called _C++ In 12 Easy Lessons._ But it took much more than that book to learn C++.

Nick had a strong interest in computers, a goal-oriented nature, and a desire to attend a well-resourced school. This led him to a magnet program for science and technology. After that he studied machine learning at MIT in the 90s, landing his first computer science job during his freshman year.

Nick notes that for those of us in the early stages of being a software engineer, the most important thing is to pick an area we are passionate about (his machine learning specialty strongly contributed to his ability to find work).

Once we have chosen a specialty we‚Äôve got to ‚Äúrefine our craft‚Äù, and ‚Äúspend a lot of time wrestling with complex coding challenges.‚Äù

If we decide we want to take a management track the next step is to become an engineering manager, where one does ‚Äúa little less day-to-day coding‚Äù in order to focus more on the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù aspect of a team.

From there we can become a director, which means managing multiple engineering managers and coordinating resources. After that is VP of engineering which means managing multiple directors while focusing on business strategy and the direction of a company.

Throughout the [interview](https://breakingintostartups.com/68-nick-caldwell-vp-engineering-reddit) Nick mentions some of the specific challenges of managing engineers, such as deciding who is going to lead a certain project or deciding which potential projects best align with the mission of the company. He deals with things like ‚Äútechnical debt‚Äù, sudden periods of high traffic, and complex operations systems.

It took Nick 13 years to climb the leadership ladder and his self-discipline has played a large role. Nick eats one large meal a day because this gives him more time to do other things. He also prioritizes goal setting and even keeps a document that tracks all of his goals from the past decade or so.

Rising to Nick‚Äôs level of management means trading in time spent coding for an influence on business decisions, company culture, and hiring processes.

Nick talks about ‚Äúsnoos day‚Äù, a great addition to Reddit‚Äôs company culture. Two days per quarter engineers across the company are able to work on passion projects and sometimes they produce [projects](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/10/snoos-day-a-reddit-tradition/) that positively impact the entire company. Managers and executives have the power to implement things like this. To set the tone. To shift the environment.

I have often wondered whether or not I‚Äôll take a management path. Would I rather develop my technical skills until I retire or become a leader who builds and mentors programmers into their greatness‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa leader who positively impacts the direction of an entire company?

I‚Äôm not sure which path I will take but Nick makes leadership sound pretty meaningful and fulfilling.

[The Breaking Into Startups interview](https://breakingintostartups.com/68-nick-caldwell-vp-engineering-reddit) is jam-packed with way more than what I‚Äôve covered here so you should definitely check out Nick‚Äôs interview, and when you‚Äôre done, let Breaking Into Startups know what you think.

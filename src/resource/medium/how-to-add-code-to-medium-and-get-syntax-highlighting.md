# How to display code blocks inÂ Medium

## And how to write inline code and embed code for syntax highlighting



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SKIAmwDYVnrMvFOopOCwPQ.png)

Donâ€™t use images of code likeÂ this.



Medium makes it easy to add code blocks and inline

#### Medium has a hidden shortcut that will turn text plainÂ textâ€¦

if (developer === true) {

follow(this.mediumPublication);

}

#### â€¦into a formatted codeÂ block:

<pre name="71db" id="71db" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--h4">if (developer === true) {</pre>

<pre name="2052" id="2052" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  follow(this.mediumPublication);</pre>

<pre name="5af7" id="5af7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">}</pre>

To accomplish this, select the text, then push:

*   **Windows**: Control + Alt + 6
*   **Mac**: Command + Option + 6
*   **Linux**: Control + Alt + 6











* * *







**Update October 19, 2016:** Medium also now supports the common convention of starting a code block with triple back-ticks. If you type ``` on a new line, Medium will now switch to code input mode. A huge thanks to [Luke Esterkyn](https://medium.com/@lukester) and the rest of the Medium team for implementing this!











* * *







You can also highlight code inline by selecting it, then clicking the backtick key (`). For example, you can format text as code `freeCodeCamp()`right in the middle of a sentence.

You can also embed GitHub gists by pasting their URL into a blank line, then pressing enter:





<iframe width="700" height="250" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/f9147c30572d1e0d5bef7d7a7f224d22?postId=d699761a5883" data-media-id="f9147c30572d1e0d5bef7d7a7f224d22" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





### How to Embed webÂ apps

As a bonus, you can embed runnable apps right into Medium. Just in case these donâ€™t render properly in Mediumâ€™s mobile apps, I recommend including links below each of the embeds as a fallback.

Paste a CodePen.io URL into Medium, then hit enter:





<iframe data-width="800" data-height="600" width="700" height="525" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/baac0b5917980fb88695bfef7c2b5304?postId=d699761a5883" data-media-id="baac0b5917980fb88695bfef7c2b5304" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You can also do this with JSFiddle.net:





<iframe data-width="600" data-height="400" width="600" height="400" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/728bdc27a4497057582d0dec61995199?postId=d699761a5883" data-media-id="728bdc27a4497057582d0dec61995199" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### But donâ€™t use images ofÂ code.

Even though it may seem convenient to take screenshots of your code and paste them into Medium, donâ€™t do this.

Medium doesnâ€™t yet have an alt-text option, so this will make your code completely inaccessible to developers who are visually impaired. And yes, [they are out there](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/looking-back-to-what-started-it-all-731ef5424aec#.fae9jgbx6).

You also canâ€™t change the font size of a static images, which makes it a pain to read on a mobile phone (which is where most people read Medium).

Finally, this makes it impossible for readers to copy and paste your code.

I know, I knowâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou shouldnâ€™t copy and paste code anyway.

But letâ€™s face itâ€Šâ€”â€Špeople do. And most people will quickly abandon your tutorial if faced with the prospect of manually typing out lots of code.

So to recap:

*   use Mediumâ€™s native code blocks
*   or embed GitHub gists
*   use working examples from CodePen and JSFiddle where possible
*   but donâ€™t paste images of code

Happy coding and writing about coding!

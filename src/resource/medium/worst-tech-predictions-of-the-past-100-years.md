# The absolute worst technology predictions of the past 150 years

Telegraph kills live communication







There’s a long-standing tradition among scientists, engineers, and industrialists. Every new year, they make predictions about a future.

Is blockchain a major technology, or it’s just a buzzword?

Bots vs Apps: who will win in 2017?

Will this finally be the year that virtual reality stops giving people motion sickness?

Well, technology has proven to be extraordinarily slippery over the past century. Despite the vast information that industry insiders have had at they’re fingertips, they’ve made some pretty terrible forecasts over the years.

The predictions that history remembers most are those that demonstrate spectacular misjudgment, misunderstanding, overly optimistic hyperbole, self-delusion, or good old-fashion wishful thinking.

Below, I’ve listed the very worst predictions, which show how even the titans of industry don’t always know what they’re talking about. Whether they were predictions about technological progress, adoption rates, or market potential, we can all agree that these predictions were dead wrong.

**1876:** _“This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” _**— William Orton**, President of Western Union.

**1932:** “_There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will._” **— _Albert Einstein_**_._

**1936:** “A rocket will never be able to leave the Earth’s atmosphere.” **— New York Times.**

**1946:** _“Television won’t be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.” _— **Darryl Zanuck**, film producer, co-founder of 20th Century Fox.

**1949:** _“Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers of the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and perhaps weigh one and a half tons.”_ **— Popular Mechanics.**

**1957:**_“I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won’t last out the year.”_ **— Editor of Prentice Hall business books.**

### Lesson learned: don’t confuse trends with facts

As Paul Krugman pointed out in his 1998 piece blissfully titled [Why most economists’ predictions are wrong](http://web.archive.org/web/19980610100009/www.redherring.com/mag/issue55/economics.html):

> _“The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in “_[_Metcalfe’s law_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)_” — which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants — becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”_

It’s my favorite prediction because as result he contradicts himself.

Predictions are a risky business. Even more so if they’re about the immediate future. Once shown to be wrong, the words return to their origin like a boomerang, and the quotes go on to forever haunt the speaker.

Thanks for reading.

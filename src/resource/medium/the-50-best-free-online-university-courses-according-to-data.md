# The 50 best free online university courses according to the data







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Z-lcdBtSY0pqSO3p.png)







I’m back with an updated list of the best free online courses of all time. Class Central [published the Top 50 list](https://www.class-central.com/report/top-moocs/) for the first time in July last year. Since then universities and course providers have added a couple of thousand new courses and Class Central users have written thousands of new reviews.

Now there are over 8,000+ massive open online courses from around 750 universities worldwide. This can be daunting to the millions of learners around the world who have never done an online course before.

That’s why we came up with a list of _Top 50 Online Courses of All Time_ based on **thousands of reviews** written by Class Central users.

In providing a small but well-reviewed list of courses, our hope is that new learners will not be overwhelmed when exploring online courses. Reviews will help new learners figure out if a course is right for them, and whether they will have a great first experience.

#### Our methodology for creating this list

Class Central has thousands of reviews written by our users, and we were able to sort these courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings.

Then we removed all the courses with less than 20 reviews (the low threshold helps smaller providers to compete on quality) and courses for which we had doubts whether they would be offered again.

If a course has multiple parts, we only included the first part in the Top 50.

#### The best courses

This top 50 list will be updated regularly as new courses are added and we receive new reviews. Better yet, you can also _follow_ the top 50 on its special [collection page](https://www.class-central.com/collection/top-free-online-courses) (look for the “follow top 50” button just below the title). Followers will receive a notification whenever we update the Top 50 courses list.

Oh … and if you feel that a course you took deserved to be on this list but isn’t, please [find the course](https://www.class-central.com/search) on Class Central and write a review for the course.

### Class Central’s Top 50 Free Online Courses of All Time

There are a lot of usual suspects in the Top 50\. Think of courses like _Learning How To Learn_, Harvard’s _CS50x_, _ModPo_, and Class Central’s [best online course of 2016](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2016/) — _Coding in your Classroom, Now!_ Courses from the founders/CEOs of edX, Coursera, and Udacity are also present.

Ajay Kapur, co-founder and CEO of arts education platform Kadenze, also has a course in the Top 50 now. His course, _Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists_, wasfirst launched on Coursera back in 2013\. He soon realized that some of the things he wanted to do with arts education were not possible with Coursera, which led him to create Kadenze.

The Top 50 also contains courses from prominent personalities, like _The Science of the Solar System_ by Mike Brown (AKA “Plutokiller”) and _Functional Programming Principles in Scala_ by Martin Odersky (the creator of Scala).

Here is a quick summary of the Top 50 list:

1.  Coursera is the top provider with 28 courses in the Top 50, and edX is second with 9 courses;
2.  Stanford and MIT top the list with four courses each, and the University of Cape Town has three courses in the Top 50 — two on FutureLearn and one on Coursera;
3.  the list includes courses from 35 universities and one research institute (Santa Fe), of which 22 universities are in the US; and
4.  Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski, the instructors of the most popular online courses in the world, have two courses in the top 50\. Their new course _Mindshift_ joins _Learning How To Learn_ in the top 50.

### Methodology

The methodology we used for this list is simple. Using thousands of reviews written by our users, Class Central was able to sort these courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings. Then we removed all the courses with less than twenty reviews (the low threshold helps smaller providers to compete on quality) and courses for which we had doubts whether they would be offered again. If a course has multiple parts, we only included the first part in the Top 50.

Note: A few of the Coursera courses in the list have a paywall for graded assignments. You can read more [about it here](https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-paywall-edx-discontinues-free-certificates/).

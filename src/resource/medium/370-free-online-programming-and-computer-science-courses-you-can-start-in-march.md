### Thought of the day:

### Image of the day:

A normal credit card payment terminal on the left, a credit card skimmer on the right. These skimmers are planted within stores by thieves and used to steal credit card information —[ sometimes for weeks without being detected](http://bit.ly/2m8hWsM).

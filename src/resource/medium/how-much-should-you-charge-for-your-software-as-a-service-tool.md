It takes time to figure out the right pricing for your Software-as-a-Service product. And even a slight mistake can end up costing you a fortune over the long run.

I can’t overestimate the importance of exploring the market around you and understanding the pricing in your niche. The good news is that I’ve already done a lot of this research for you.

This collection of charts — which are based off the current prices of 1,530 SaaS products — will give you a good idea of the distribution of prices in your vertical.

SaaS starter prices distribution by niche







When I try to come up with the right pricing for my SaaS web services, I start by analyzing the minimum prices of my direct and indirect competitors. After collecting the data-points I plot them on a chart and look for spikes there. The spikes mean that there is a distinct price segment here which in turn means the presence of demand.

By the way, the absence of a spike in a place where it ought to be could mean that there is an opportunity to enter the niche.

Here is what my team has collected by visiting every single SaaS in the respective categories of software catalogs.

First, a few words on how these data were collected.

We had lists of SaaS web services from several software catalogs. By going through every item on those lists, we found the minimum price for each SaaS. Then I filtered out free services and the services that costs more than $500, and put the data on the charts.

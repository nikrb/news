# How to put your expertise in a box and sell it

At RISE Conf in Hong Kong, [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://medium.com/@garyvee) was asked:

> How do I make a living of my passion?

The answer from the marketing mogul was straightforward and brilliant:

> Put it in a box and sell it.

That is it. Everyone’s got knowledge, or a passion. You can share it or sell it.

All you need to do is package it.

> Toolbox are the way to package your knowledge and sell it.

Below is a snap of why you would want to put together a toolbox.

#### Firstly — what’s a Toolbox?

#### And secondly — what’s in it for you?

In other words, why should you spend a sheer amount of time putting together a valuable set of information and/or tools _for free_ to be shared.

### What is a toolbox?

If you type “toolbox” into [DuckDuckGo](https://medium.com/@duckduckgo) (yeah, I [care](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-asked-my-friends-to-stop-using-whatsapp-and-telegram-e93346b3c1f0) about privacy) you get this definition from _Wikipedia:_

> A **toolbox** (also called **toolkit**, **tool chest** or **workbox**) is a [box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box "Box") to organize, carry, and protect the owner’s [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool "Tool"). They could be used for trade, a hobby or [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself "Do it yourself"), and their content vary with the craft of the owner.

Er, kind of— at least we have some interesting keywords here: _organize_, _tools_, _use for trade_ (I like that one), _DIY_ (sounds right), and _craft of the owner_.

### That kind of make senses but it is not quite what a startup toolbox is

So far, we’ve seen two kinds of toolbox in the startup space:

*   Informational toolbox
*   Product & service toolbox

#### Informational toolbox:

Those ones are covering startups ecosystems, like [Singapore](https://www.slideshare.net/arnaudbonzom/singapore-startup-ecosystem-and-entrepreneur-toolbox-51515671) or [Hong Kong](https://www.scribd.com/document/356331184/Startup-Toolbox), and about [50 other ecosystems](https://www.arnaudbonzom.com/startup-ecosystems-presentations/). You can find resources such as macro data, influencers, investors, majors events and startups — useful to promote an ecosystems and its main players.

There are also the ones for you to get into a new field — such as [crypto](https://medium.com/blockchannel/the-crypto-noobs-toolbox-b405fb0916b6).

The definition could be something along these lines:

> A set of information and resources to help your audience understand the environment and opportunities.

#### Product — or computing — toolbox:

Those are the [coder’s toolbox](https://hackernoon.com/what-should-be-in-a-coders-toolbox-96674fc8fb74) type aggregating apps, Saas or commands for you to [build your own products](http://www.startupdash.co/) or [learn](https://hackernoon.com/basic-javascript-algorithms-toolbox-starter-kit-dc2af3ceebad) a few javascript quick-to-write algorithms.

And that is definition from _Oxford dictionary_:

> A set of software tools

### Thanks for that, but what’s in it for me?

Below is what’s in it for you if you spend time putting together a toolbox:

*   Build up your credibility in that field — ecosystem expert, UX expert, etc.
*   Become an influencer in that field — speak on panels, prepare a keynote based on your toolbox.
*   Become _the_ point of contact — [Arnaud Bonzom](https://medium.com/@arnaud.bonzom) with his Singapore’s ecosystem toolbox got over 150,000 views (V1&2) . If someone wants to know something about Singapore ecosystem, he will be the first person they think of. Fun fact: you might also become a _toolbox influencer_, 6 other decks have used Arnaud Bonzom’s framework to publish their toolbox.
*   Generate leads (collect email addresses, and get direct inquiries) — you can have people to download your toolbox freely if you wish, you can also collect their email address for each download.
*   Build your brand awareness — remember — Singapore’s ecosystem toolbox: over 150,000 views of Arnaud Bonzom’s face and name.
*   Build a community around you, get people to engage conversation with you, build your business, leverage on that toolbox.

If you’ve made it to the end, feel free to clap :), thanks.

And if you are hustling to build a community for your business, take a look at how we built a community at 33,000 feet in 80 hours:

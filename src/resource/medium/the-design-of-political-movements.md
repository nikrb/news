# The Design of Political Movements







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A4UBe48kVL7NbjgmHo5wwg.jpeg)







As designers, we can apply our skills to shape public opinion, and ultimately affect political change.

This article will explore some of the ways designers have made an impact in the past through **branding**, **product design**, and **graphic design**.

### **Branding**

Branding is a powerful tool. Branding is a promise of shared values. It unities different people into a single unit by a unified message from many. As designers we can lend our skills to define identities and brands for change.

#### [**Solidarnosc**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_%28Polish_trade_union%29)

Branding was at the core of the Solidarity movement during Communist Poland, which was founded in 1980 as a strike for workers rights.

From the beginning of the strikes, designer [Jerzy Janiszewski](http://washington.mfa.gov.pl/en/bilateral_cooperation/press/newsletter/interviews/janiszewski) wanted to unite the hodgepodge of mottos and signs. A poet suggested to him a simple motto “[Solidarnosc](http://washington.mfa.gov.pl/en/bilateral_cooperation/press/newsletter/interviews/janiszewski).” Jerzy went home and, after only three tries, created the logo and thus branded the movement.

The logo and motto served as the common symbol across many Polish protest movements. The graphic simplicity of the identity is so expressive that it resonates today.

#### [The Obama Hope Poster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster)

The Obama Hope Poster is an iconic design by Shepard Fairey. The poster originated as an unofficial image. Its graphic boldness intertwined with the clear message “Hope” made the image unforgettable.

The image started as a limited addition poster but it quickly spread to mass markets prints, t-shirts, and more paraphernalia. Its viral spread resulting in it becoming the most common representation of Obama’s 2008 election. The design was so successful, it generated a subculture of [imitation and parody variations](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obama-hope-posters).

#### [**The Women’s March and the Pussy Hat**](https://www.womensmarch.com)

The Women’s March was a grassroots protest held across the globe on January 21, 2017\. It was a global march with five million people participating. It’s estimated that [four million](http://www.vox.com/2017/1/22/14350808/womens-marches-largest-demonstration-us-history-map) people joined in the United States.

The march was in support of human rights as a voice of dissent to the new executive administration. It was also a spontaneous demonstration of people expressing their creativity and dissent.

The pussy hat project was a standalone grassroots project for the Women’s March. The goal was to create a low cost unique visual statement to create unity at the March. The Pussy hat is a powerful tactic, as it [united many aspects of femininity](https://www.pussyhatproject.com/mission/) into a symbol of protest. Pink is associated with feminine qualities.

Traditionally, knitting is a woman’s craft. Also it’s a collaborative activity with women knitting together in a group. The title and design of the hat is a play on the derogatory name for female genitalia. The Pussy Hat is an example of a playful subversive design that serves as a powerful brand.

#### The Make America Great Again trucker cap

The #MAGA cap is a strong brand. The cap and logo are more sophisticated than meets the eye. The trucker cap is a tribal mark. A [retro identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trucker_hat) with a rural America of farmers and truck drivers. How can you miss the loud solid red cap with white all caps screaming “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?”

[A sea of red caps at a Trump rally in Fredericksburg](http://wtvr.com/2016/08/20/donald-trump-fredericksburg-rally-video/)



The typography is intentionally not sophisticated. It’s a logo that anyone can type out with [MS Word](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-ca-cam-anger-donald-trump-make-america-great-again-hat-20160706-snap-story.html). The font is either [Times New Roman](http://www.dafont.com/forum/read/234166/donald-trump-make-america-great-again-hat-font) or [New Century Schoolbook](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/1019796/). The MAGA cap appears as a kitschy relic. Instead it’s an unmissable deliberate identity. The cap is a badge.

### Product Design

The election also resulted in the launch of a new wave of apps and websites. Tech workers upset with the election built the services as night and weekend projects. As designers we can bring our expertise of research, interaction and UI design to build more services for change.

#### [5 Calls](https://5calls.org)

### Graphic Design

Graphic design is also a powerful communication tool. Clear and concise visual design is critical to making your message heard. Graphic designers can lend their skills to make these communication efforts loud and clear.

### What Can You Do as a Designer?

What can you do as designers to bring about change? First, you can take a deep breath. You should try and find issues that you believe in (you can’t tackle everything).

You can discover legislation that you care about and call your congressional representatives. You can also find individuals and organizations that need your skills. This way, you can use your skills to fulfill your civic duty of making change in our government and society.

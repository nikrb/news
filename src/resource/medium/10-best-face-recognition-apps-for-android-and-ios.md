Here are some of the best apps for facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics. These can help secure your software and your your Android and — in some cases — iOS devices.

### #1\. FaceLock

Facial recognition may not be brand new but the app FaceLock is a free app that protects your other apps using only your face. Facelock is the only key to unlock your highly confidential files and frequently used apps.

After the installation of the app, it’ll navigate and give directions you to a main menu that has a list of options, allowing you to customize the performance of the app.

To enable the FaceLock functionality, you just need to click on the “Enable FaceLock” option. The FaceLock will start doing its job whenever someone tries to access the restricted apps on your phone, locking them down if it senses an intruder.

There is a free as well as a paid version and has a pro version of FaceLock.

### #2\. True Key

True Key by Intel Security Productivity frees you from needing to type in long passwords to access the apps. If it doesn’t recognize your face, it will then ask for fingerprint biometrics for further access.

Once you sign in with the True Key app with your preferred method, your devices will trust you.

### #3\. FindFace

FindFace identifies with 70% accuracy and reliability. If you snap a photo of a stranger, you can then find out who that person is through their social media profile. For now, it works with [VK](http://vk.com/), a popular Russian social network.

FindFace is mainly used for identification, verification, and documentation. It can search 250 million faces in 0.3 seconds. It maintains this pace, and that is an important criteria for its performance.

It recently reached 95% of accuracy in some circumstances, thanks to neural network trained to near perfection. With a cross-platform API, it can run on any web, mobile, or desktop application.

### #4\. FaceVault

This only works and ensure security for iPhone, iPads, and iPods. An app known as FaceVault delivers face identification, then unlocks the iOS device for any feature beyond those that allow for the slide-to-share gesture.

FaceVault uses your device’s front-facing camera to scan your face. Even if you wear makeup or glasses, your face can be easily detected.

If it fails to detect your face, you will be switched to another mode, where you can unlock the app with a pattern-based code.

### #5\. Face Detection

The FaceDetection screen lock is another high-security face detection screen lock app, which is an appropriate app for privacy and the security of your digital property.

The Face Detection app will let unlock your phone only when it detects your face. You can use the Face Detection screen lock for both locking your individual apps as well as a screen lock. But there’s also a password option if facial recognition fails.

You have to train your phone to recognize your face before being able to lock your screen. This is a one-time process. It will ask you to set your security level to be low, medium or high. The next step would be enabling or disabling the screen lock per your preference and setting a password.

### #6\. Luxand face recognition

Luxand allows you to tap any detected face and give it a name. This app will then memorize that face and recognize it in the future.

Luxand is basically used for face identification, surveillance, time and control monitory systems, which use the biometric identification for more accurate analysis with a high level of local security.

### #7\. Face Lock Screen

This app trains on your face and automatically recognizes you. You don’t need any technical skills to be able to use it. Just set your password and check the box to enable this on your lock screen.

### #8\. AppLock Face

This app locks any apps that you want to keep private. It ensures that only you can access your personal information.

It uses your face as the biometric key to unlock your apps.

### #9\. Oasis Face

Oasis Face is an authenticated solution for screen lock that uses biometric face recognition. It reduces the need for passwords and other login procedures.

Oasis Face has a fully-featured cross platform SDK. It also has an optimized library for iOS and Android mobile devices.

It comes with greater higher accuracy and authenticity than most other apps I’ve listed here, and very little maintenance is required. It even has a modular architecture to evaluate the performance of its face authentication for mobile devices and server side.

### #10\. Nametag

This is an app that recognizes and unlocks your screen through your online or public [profile](http://profile.it/). It runs on Android and iOS.

[facialnetwork.com](http://facialnetwork.com/) is currently working on technologies which can scan and verify profile pictures from the online dating apps and [more](http://more.it/). It may even recognize faces by looking at blurred images. It can also instantly search out the person’s occupation, age, and can take you to their social media accounts in real-time.

# _WebSlides: a new open source way to build beautiful presentations that run in your¬†browser_

Everyone loves stories. People share content that makes them feel inspired. We need stories to know we‚Äôre not alone.

Slide decks are an excellent way to tell these stories. And there are already plenty of great tools out there for this like Powerpoint and Keynote.

But nobody loves HTML presentations. Literally, no one. ‚ÄúI love HTML presentations‚Äù returns [zero results](https://www.google.es/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#newwindow=1&q=%22I+love+HTML+presentations%22&search_plus_one=form) in Google search. ü§î

I‚Äôm a designer and developer who works all day on top of the giant platform that is the web. It always felt awkward and old-fashion for me to load up a separate program on my computer and use Powerpoint and Keynote‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith their strange proprietary formats‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen have to email it to someone.

So I built [WebSlides](https://webslides.tv).

WebSlides are all about **telling a story, then sharing it in a beautiful way:** hypertext, clean markup, and lovely CSS as narrative elements.

Designing in WebSlides can be just as fast as with Powerpoint. You can get by with a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Just choose a [demo](https://webslides.tv/demos) and customize it in minutes.

Designers, developers, marketers, and journalists now have a web-native presentation tool with:

*   Quick navigation keyboard shortcuts such (and both horizontal and vertical sliding).
*   Permalinks that take you directly to a specific slide.
*   A slide counter.
*   [+40 components](https://webslides.tv/demos/components) including covers, cards, quotes, and forms
*   A wide variety of backgrounds: colors, gradients, images, and videos.
*   Flexible blocks with auto-fill and equal height.
*   500+ SVG icons thanks to Font Awesome

Demos: [Landings](https://webslides.tv/demos/landings) ¬∑ [Portfolios](https://webslides.tv/demos/portfolios) ¬∑¬†[Keynote](https://webslides.tv/demos/keynote).







### Code Poetry

Here‚Äôs some [HTML source code](https://webslides.tv) that shows you how it‚Äôs done. This code is clean, scalable, and well-documented. It uses intuitive markup with [popular naming conventions](https://webslides.tv/demos/classes). **There‚Äôs no need to overuse classes or nesting**.

Each parent `_  
  **<!-- Slide 1 -->**  
  **Design for trust</h1>  
  ****  
  **<!-- Slide 2 -->**  
  ****  
      
      <h2>.wrap = container 1200px</h2>  
      
  ****  
</article></pre>

### **Designing with¬†purpose**

WebSlides is free and [open source](https://github.com/jlantunez/webslides). I built it because we need a platform for beautiful storytelling. Let‚Äôs look at what is happening:

*   [Medium](https://medium.com) = Beautiful articles.
*   [Typeform](http://typeform.com) = Beautiful forms.
*   [WebSlides](https://webslides.tv) = Beautiful presentations and longforms.

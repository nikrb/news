Here are three links worth your time:

2.  Material Design and the Mystery Meat Navigation Problem ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kjl59S))
3.  The Right Way to Test React Components ([13 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jUCgLy))

Bonus: GitLab published a full timeline of what happened when one of their engineers accidentally deleted their production database ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jIS88Y))

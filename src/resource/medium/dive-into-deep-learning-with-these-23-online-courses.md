Before we start, you may be asking yourself: “What exactly is deep learning?” Here’s a succinct description:

> “Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.”

> — Jason Brownlee from [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/)

Without further ado…

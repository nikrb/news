Here are three links worth your time:

1.  How to use spaced repetition with Anki to learn to code faster ([10 minute read](http://bit.ly/2k9TsA8))
2.  The many, many ways that cryptographic software can fail ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jFLoZj))
3.  Zenimax successfully sued Oculus VR for $500 million. Here’s what Oculus VR CTO John Carmack had to say about the expert witness’s argument of “non-literal copying” of code ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kZNbbQ))

Bonus: It’s cold out there! So pick up a toasty freeCodeCamp hoodie today [in our community’s shop](http://bit.ly/2k9Sns8).

Here are three links worth your time:

1.  How designers engineer luck into video games ([12 minute read](http://bit.ly/2ikWna4))
2.  Why you should ask questions at your next tech company interview ([6 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jMG0TT))
3.  CodePens’ 100 most-hearted projects on CodePen for 2016 ([5 to 60 minute browse](http://bit.ly/2isDEaJ))

Bonus: Disruptcast interviewed me the origins of freeCodeCamp and advice I have for people starting open source projects ([1 hour listen](http://bit.ly/2iopyUR))

### Thought of the day:

“Chess is historically a very balanced game that is entirely up to the skill of the player. This is great if you want to see who is better at chess but not so good if you’re trying to play a fun game with your friends of varying skill levels.” — Zach Gage, creator of [Really Bad Chess](http://reallybadchess.com/)

### Funny of the day:

My car finally made it home!

Happy coding!

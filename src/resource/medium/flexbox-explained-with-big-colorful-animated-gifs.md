Here are three links worth your time:

1.  How Flexbox works — explained with big, colorful, animated gifs ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jVr0PR))
2.  How to commit entire files and directories to GitHub using GitHub.js ([6 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kW94ot))
3.  GitLab — an open source alternative to GitHub — accidentally deleted their production data, and all five of their backup methods have failed ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kVRUr0))

# What I learned from Stack Overflow‚Äôs massive survey of 64,000 developers

Today Stack Overflow released the results of their 2017 survey of more than 64,000 developers.

[Just like in 2016](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/2-out-of-3-developers-are-self-taught-and-other-insights-from-stack-overflow-s-2016-survey-of-50-8cf0ee5d4c21#.lkodanohw), I‚Äôve combed through these results and summarized them for you.

Here‚Äôs a lightning-fast snapshot of what the software development profession looks like in 2017.

#### A vast majority of developers consider themselves ‚Äúweb developers.‚Äù

#### Most web developers consider themselves ‚Äúfull stack developers.‚Äù

#### JavaScript is by far the most popular tool programmers use¬†today.

#### Developers work in a wide variety of industries‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost of them outside of what we traditionally call¬†‚Äútech.‚Äù







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6hkRXbI6OO8Jm8RmB5ZmPQ.png)







#### Most of them work at companies with fewer than 500 employees.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0URhaTKMKzYS_yPv8irdNQ.png)







#### But less than 1 in 5 of them work at a¬†startup.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*iMX4whMLbWI7d7-4XSGUxw.png)







#### Most of them work as full-time employees.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*DWPnFnOVmlDSSZ7RZkzGZg.png)







#### Two-thirds of them got their current job through someone they already knew, or were approached by a recruiter.

#### Regardless of their specialization, developers make good¬†money.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NP46IwS_xDiIL5UUwJVGvQ.png)







#### And if they happen to be in America, they make even more¬†money.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IbZKAN5iW6EIQUFmhTm3SA.png)







#### This said, most of them feel underpaid for the caliber of work they¬†do.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cvO1AYWLYvZ51UDe15JT2w.png)







#### Two out of three developers work from home at least a few days a¬†month.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*P11m0xkLaq39awP8R52lCQ.png)







#### And they prefer to listen to music while they¬†work.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Jl3QwgL0Y3_9QpYSpXdMUQ.png)







#### 30% of all developers have been coding for less than 5¬†years.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Yul-1yLwqUB7GmBVhGg5TQ.png)







#### Most developers went to college, but nearly a quarter of working developers never finished a 4-year¬†degree.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WEnpvDySEfbTw4izv9FwNQ.png)







#### 80% of college-educated developers studied some kind of technology-related major.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7JkTvmdR2yWrnIk4muj1Bg.png)







#### Despite this, less than half of developers consider their formal education to be ‚Äúimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúvery important‚Äù to their¬†jobs.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8Q7fXnNmSba06vphUsDQYw.png)







#### Even though software development is dominated by men, it‚Äôs becoming more diverse. Just [one year ago](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/2-out-of-3-developers-are-self-taught-and-other-insights-from-stack-overflow-s-2016-survey-of-50-8cf0ee5d4c21#.lkodanohw), 93% of respondents were male. This time, only 89%¬†were.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*16qJaCjJ1W5tUDGGV4k4vA.png)







#### 1 in 100 developers are blind, and 1 in 200 developers are¬†deaf.

freeCodeCamp contributor [Florian Beijers](https://medium.com/@zersiax) was born blind. You can read how he‚Äôs able to [program using a standard-issue laptop](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/looking-back-to-what-started-it-all-731ef5424aec#.1amcxxdrq).

Thanks for reading. If you have time, you can read through the [full survey results](https://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017) and share your insights in the comments section below.

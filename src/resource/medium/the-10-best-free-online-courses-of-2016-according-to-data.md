# The 10 best free online courses of 2016 according to the data

Last year, for the first time ever, I published a list of Class Central’s [best online courses for the year](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2015/). And now we’re back with a list of the best online courses of 2016\. Like last year, I based this list on thousands of reviews written by Class Central’s users.

My methodology is simple. I made a list of all the courses that were offered for the first time in 2016 — which comes out to be about 2,600 courses — ranked them by the Bayesian average of their ratings, then filtered out the ones with less than ten reviews.

### The best courses

This year’s list has some familiar faces from 2015 — Santa Fe Institute’s Complexity Explorer, the University of Illionis’ Aric Rindfleisch, and the University of Capetown. Interestingly, last year it was a FutureLearn course from the University of Capetown made it to the Top 10, and this year it’s a Coursera course.

It might not be surprising that the best online course of 2016 is related to coding. But what’s surprising is that the course is meant for teachers and is taught in Italian.

_“Coding in your Classroom, Now!_” is taught by the University of Urbino.

Coding in your Classroom, Now!



The second highest rated course is an introductory Chinese language course from Tsinghua University on edX. It took a while, but online courses for learning languages are finally here. You can find all of them [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/language-learning-moocs/).

Kadenze, an online course platform that was [launched](https://www.class-central.com/report/kadenze/) last year by an ex-Coursera instructor, also made it into the list with two courses. One of those courses,“_The Nature of Code_” is taught by Daniel Shiffman, who also runs the popular YouTube channel [Coding Rainbow.](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

The other universities that have courses in the list are Stanford (Coursera), the University of Minnesota (Coursera), and Stellenbosch University (FutureLearn).

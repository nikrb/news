# Powering up with GitHub

_Originally published on our now-defunct blog on August 5, 2015._

As we integrate more tightly with Gitter, it makes sense for us to also make better use of GitHub.

We’ve ditched our old Field Guide articles in favor of [our new GitHub-based Wiki](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki), which allows for much easier article creation and revision. These Wiki articles can now be retrieved from Gitter thanks to our new Camper Bot.

CamperBot is here to help, and has already started answering campers’ questions and retrieving resources in some of our chat rooms. Soon we’ll introduce CamperBot into all of our chat rooms.

Starting later this week, your Free Code Camp username will be tied to your GitHub username. We will also tie other optional fields, such as your name and location, to GitHub.  

This will make it easier for you to learn more about whom you’re chatting with. It will also make it possible for you to give other campers Brownie Points for helping you in our help chat rooms.  

One other benefit is that Free Code Camp public portfolios will be simpler to manage, and give you a consistent personal brand across GitHub, Gitter and Free Code Camp.

Our new GitHub integration will be much simpler.



By popular request, we are also hiding Bonfire Solutions from your public portfolio, and will reintroduce them later in a better way once we roll out our revamped public portfolios.

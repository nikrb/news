# Best Gitter channels: Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime environment and a library. It allows to run JavaScript code in the backend, outside a browser by making use of Google’s V8 VM, the same runtime environment for JavaScript as the one used by Google Chrome. It’s lightweight, efficient, and [enjoys continuous popularity](https://www.quora.com/Is-Node-js-declining-already).

The Node.js package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. We have a bunch of Node-related channels on Gitter — check them out & join the conversation!

It makes it possible to write super easy [Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29) tests in your favorite BDD/TDD test framework, that will run locally or in the cloud using Sauce Labs, BrowserStack or TestingBot. WebdriverIO is agnostic with regards to the test framework you want to use. Cucumber, Jasmine and Mocha+Chai are supported by the configuration wizard, and you can use other frameworks as well — for example [Yadda](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate).
*   [**feross/webtorrent **](https://gitter.im/feross/webtorrent?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=node)— WebTorrent is a streaming torrent client for node.js and the browser.

In node.js, this module is a simple torrent client, using TCP and UDP to talk to other torrent clients. In the browser, WebTorrent uses WebRTC (data channels) for peer-to-peer transport. It can be used without browser plugins, extensions, or installations. It’s Just JavaScript™.

Here are three links worth your time:

1.  Here are 515 free online programming courses that start this month ([1 to 30 minute read](http://bit.ly/2oIsjEJ))
2.  I needed a guitar teacher. So I turned my Alexa into one ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2oD01hW))
3.  My open source Instagram bot got me 2,500 real followers for $5 in server costs ([12 minute read](http://bit.ly/2oa3y6u))

Bonus: The “this” keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript. Here Beau explain how “this” works in detail ([9 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2oDc5j1))

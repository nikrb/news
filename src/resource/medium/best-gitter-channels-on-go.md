# Best Gitter channels on: Go

Go, also known as [Golang](https://golang.org/), is a open-source programming language developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.

Originally intended as a descendent of C++ for the 21st century, Golang is characterized by fast compilation, easier syntax, and an efficient garbage collection. It’s a clean, fast, typed language that is particularly strong for web development.

Here’s a list of Go-related communities that we’re hosting on [Gitter](http://gitter.im). Feel free to join the conversation.

*   [**docker/docker** ](https://gitter.im/docker/docker?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container. Docker containers are both _hardware-agnostic_ and _platform-agnostic_. Docker began as an open-source implementation of the deployment engine which powered [dotCloud](http://web.archive.org/web/20130530031104/https://www.dotcloud.com/), a popular Platform-as-a-Service. It benefits directly from the experience accumulated over several years of large-scale operation and support of hundreds of thousands of applications and databases.
*   [**drone/drone**](https://gitter.im/drone/drone?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go) — Drone is a Continuous Delivery platform built on Docker, written in Go. Every build is executed inside an ephemeral Docker container, giving developers complete control over their build environment with guaranteed isolation.
*   [**minio/minio**](https://gitter.im/minio/minio) — [Minio](https://minio.io) is an object storage server compatible with Amazon S3 and licensed under Apache 2.0 License.
*   [**gogits/gogs**](https://gitter.im/gogits/gogs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go) — The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.
*   [**google/gxui **](https://gitter.im/google/gxui?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)**— **An experimental Go cross platform UI library.
*   [**spf13/hugo **](https://gitter.im/spf13/hugo?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built with love in GoLang
*   [**Go-lang-idea-plugin**](https://gitter.im/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— Google Go language IDE built using the IntelliJ Platform [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5047](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5047)
*   [**gin-gonic/gin **](https://gitter.im/gin-gonic/gin?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API with much better performance — up to 40 times faster.
*   [**labstack/echo**](https://gitter.im/labstack/echo?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go) — Fast and unfancy HTTP server framework for Go (Golang). Up to 10x faster than the rest. [https://echo.labstack.com](https://echo.labstack.com/)
*   [**influxdata/influxdb**](https://gitter.im/influxdata/influxdb?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— Open source time series database with no external dependencies. It’s useful for recording metrics, events, and performing analytics.
*   [**aws/aws-sdk-go**](https://gitter.im/aws/aws-sdk-go?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)** — **aws-sdk-go is the official AWS SDK for the Go programming language.
*   [**FreeCodeCamp/go**](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/go?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=go)— If you’re a beginner, this is the best place to discuss Go and get help with it.
*   [**derekparker/delve**](https://gitter.im/derekparker/delve)** — **Delve is a debugger for the Go programming language.
*   [**CodisLabs/codis**](https://gitter.im/CodisLabs/codis)** — **Codis is a proxy based high performance Redis cluster solution written in Go. It is production-ready and widely used at many companies.
*   [**blevesearch/bleve**](https://gitter.im/blevesearch/bleve)** — **Modern text indexing in Go.
*   [**go-mangos/mangos**](https://gitter.im/go-mangos/mangos)** — **Package mangos is an implementation in pure Go of the SP (“Scalable Protocols”) protocols.
*   [**linkeddata/gold**](https://gitter.im/linkeddata/gold)** — **gold is a reference Linked Data Platform server for the [**Solid platform**](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec). Written in Go, based on [initial work done by William Waites](https://bitbucket.org/ww/gold).

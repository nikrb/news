# Bootstrap 4: Everything You Need to¬†Know

## A deep dive into solving common responsive web design¬†problems











![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XJhVE27AcycpeaWMhoqZ9w.png)






Excerpt from [Understanding Bootstrap: Everything you need to¬†know](http://www.learnbootstrap.today)







This article will cover the practical fundamentals you need to start building responsive websites with the latest version of Bootstrap, version 4.

You may be wondering‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhy did Ohans write this 17,000 word guide to Bootstrap? After all, browser support for Flexbox and Grid are on the rise.

Well I‚Äôve got good news for you‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm well aware of these trends. I wrote [a comprehensive intro to Flexbox](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af) a while back, and I‚Äôve written [more Medium articles on Flexbox and Grid](https://medium.com/flexbox-and-grids) than any other developer.

This said, I think there are still plenty of situations where knowing the latest version of Bootstrap will help you.

There‚Äôs no one tool for every use case.

By the way, If you don‚Äôt know CSS well, I recommend learning it well first. Instead, get a decent [CSS education](http://bit.ly/learn_css). Understand [Flexbox](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af), and perhaps learn how the [CSS Grid](https://medium.com/flexbox-and-grids/how-to-efficiently-master-the-css-grid-in-a-jiffy-585d0c213577) layout works too. Then tackle Bootstrap 4.

But if you feel ready, let‚Äôs proceed. üòé

### A Quick Note on Bootstrap 4

Bootstrap 4 is the latest version of the widely popular front-end framework, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Bootstrap 4 has a lot of new exciting features and capabilities that make building responsive designs even easier than before. The biggest add-on is that it is heavily built on Flexbox.

### Should I Still Learn Bootstrap in¬†2017?

Years ago, the main reason I learned Bootstrap was the ease of building responsive designs. However, before the release of the new version of Bootstrap, I stopped using the framework. Why?

With the advent of Flexbox and CSS Grid, I found it easier to build responsive modules using native CSS support.

Among experienced developers, my guess is that Bootstrap is less popular. This is a personal opinion, not a verified fact. But, whether you‚Äôre an old hand, or new to the world of responsive designs, there are still good reasons to learn Bootstrap:

#### 1\. Fast Prototyping

There are lots of other tools and frameworks that make prototyping fast. For instance, you may have heard of [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/).

Bootstrap is an equal contender here. Many would argue they do not need some of the other features of the framework. Yet, Bootstrap allows you to customize and pick what modules are relevant to you.

#### 2\. Responsive Web¬†Design

For beginners, responsive web design is a big deal. It‚Äôs easy to laugh it off when you‚Äôre an experienced developer, but think back to when you started. That sh*t was hard to pull off. Bootstrap makes it relatively easy.

#### 3\. Old¬†Codebase

When I stopped using Bootstrap for personal and new projects, I still had to refactor and maintain an old codebase at work. Whether you like it or not, a lot of older codebases are written in Bootstrap. You don‚Äôt want to look clueless just because you are ‚Äúpro_‚Äù_ and don‚Äôt like Bootstrap.

#### 4\. The Latest Version is Smarter and¬†Better

The new Bootstrap version 4 is a lot smarter. It is built on top of Flexbox, and comes with a lot of savor we will explore in later sections of this article.

#### 5\. Greater Ease of Customization

The new Bootstrap 4 is a lot easier to customize.

I hated Bootstrap because you had to use Less or Sass for any meaningful customization. While that is still partly true, version 4 is a lot more customizable than the previous versions.

Bootstrap isn‚Äôt going to disappear that quickly. You can read more about whether it is worth the learn or not in this freeCodeCamp [forum discussion](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/will-bootstrap-be-dropped/73378/21):

[**Will Bootstrap be dropped?**  
_"Every bootstrap website ever!" - it's even EASIER than that, why learn front end/gui at all? Just type Monster‚Ä¶_forum.freecodecamp.org](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/will-bootstrap-be-dropped/73378/21 "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/will-bootstrap-be-dropped/73378/21")[](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/will-bootstrap-be-dropped/73378/21)

### What You‚Äôll¬†Learn

1.  I will teach you the fundamentals of how Bootstrap works.
2.  I will walk you through what is different in this new version of Bootstrap. If you‚Äôre a more experienced developer, this section will interest you.
3.  I have spent a lot of hours studying the Bootstrap framework. I will show you some of the helpful tips I have found along the way.¬†  
    This will make your work with the framework easier.
4.  Learning the fundamentals is cool. What‚Äôs even cooler is applying these fundamentals to build real-world apps.
5.  I‚Äôll walk you through building a lot of ‚Äúsmall things.‚Äù Then, I‚Äôll wrap things up with this [startup homepage](https://codepen.io/ohansemmanuel/full/zEKrxP/) completely built with Bootstrap 4.



























































A couple screens from the [demo](https://codepen.io/ohansemmanuel/full/zEKrxP/) we will¬†build.







Aren‚Äôt those pretty?

Most people say, ‚Äúall Bootstrap sites look the same._‚Äù_ I disagree. The statement should read, ‚Äúall **poorly built** Bootstrap sites look the same._‚Äù_

I‚Äôm excited to show you how to build beautiful sites using Bootstrap. I hope you are too.

### What you Should¬†Know

*   I assume you have a good understanding of how `HTML` and `CSS` works.¬†  
    If you don‚Äôt know CSS very well, I recommend taking my [Complete Introduction to CSS](https://bit.ly/learn_css) (paid course with over 70 lessons).
*   You should have a decent knowledge of how Flexbox works.¬†  
    Please read this [detailed flexbox guide](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af), or this [example focused guide](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-flexbox-learning-through-examples-8c90248d4676) for a refresher on Flexbox.

### **_What is new in Bootstrap version¬†4?_**

This section is targeted towards more experienced developers. If you‚Äôre new to the front-end space, skip this and come back after reading the other sections of the article.

The latest version of Bootstrap, version 4, is packed with a few vital changes.

#### 1\. The default border-box value has been¬†changed

Earlier versions of the bootstrap framework set the `border-box` value to `content-box.` Most people like myself found this annoying most of the time.

Now the Bootstrap team has switched the value to `border-box`. I find this is easier to understand.

#### 2\. Opinionated CSS¬†Resets

[CSS Resets](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) have come a long way. In this version of Bootstrap, the CSS Reset stylesheet is called Reboot.

Reboot does a few things differently. It is based on Normalize. It avoids `margin-top`¬†, embraces the CSS `inherit` value, uses the `rem` unit heavily, and embraces the use of native font stack for optimum text rendering.

I advise you to take 10 minutes to read about Reboot from the official [docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/). It‚Äôs quite a good read.














### Introduction to How Bootstrap Works

This section is geared towards those not familiar with how Bootstrap works. You may skip this if you‚Äôre a more experienced developer.

Let‚Äôs begin.

The usual flow for creating a basic web page goes like this:

1.  Write a basic markup document (HTML)
2.  Style the page using CSS

Let‚Äôs pretend for a bit to do just that.

Consider the basic markup below:

<pre name="633f" id="633f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h1>Hello World</h1>  
<h2>Hi, there. Hello again</h2>  
Link to my website</pre>

The markup has two header elements and an anchor tag. Below is the result when viewed in a browser.












The result of the basic¬†markup



This is exactly what you may have hoped for, but the result goes on to show a fundamental truth. Let‚Äôs dig into why this is important.

Take a look at the result above. The `h1` element is displayed larger than the `h2` element, and the `a` tag is blue‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby default.

Did you notice that we get these styles without writing any CSS?

Why?

This is a result of the Browser‚Äôs default styles.

The takeaway is, browsers have default stylesheets that affect the appearance of webpages.

How can we prevent this default behavior?

The solution is pretty simple. You can override the default browser styles with your own styles through CSS.

For example:

<pre name="9617" id="9617" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">h1 {  
  color: blue  
}</pre>

<pre name="02dd" id="02dd" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">a {  
  color: black  
}</pre>

This time, I have swapped the colors. The link, `black` and the `h1` blue.












The default browser styles have now been overridden. The link now appears `black` and the h1 `is`blue.



That was easy.

### Where does Bootstrap fit into all of¬†this?

The browser affected the display of the page without your intervention. Using frameworks like Bootstrap can significantly alter the display of your webpages‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith little or no intervention from you.

So, it works like this:

Every webpage‚Äôs overall style is influenced by the browser‚Äôs default styles, styles from frameworks such as Bootstrap and your own written CSS.
















A quick look at the styles that influence the look of every¬†webpage.







Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt get it now, I will explain with an example.

Assume I wrote a CSS library called, `**cowbell**`_._ `**Cowbell**` does only one thing. I included the library, perhaps through a cdn link. It gave my page a background color that looks ‚Äúcowbell‚Äù like.

Somewhere within the `**cowbell**` library, I would have gone ahead to write this:

<pre name="5b03" id="5b03" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.cowbell {  
   background-color: cowbell  
}</pre>

Note that all I have done is include a¬†`.cowbell` class with an equivalent `background-color.`

For the records, there‚Äôs no color like ‚Äúcowbell‚Äù.

When you include the cowbell library in your page, how do use it?

Simple.

You just add the class of¬†`.cowbell` to any element you want to give a `cowbell` color.

Something like this:

<pre name="c403" id="c403" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><!--- this is my awesome HTML document -->  
<body **class="cowbell"**>  
  This is my awesome site  
</body></pre>

Since I have already defined the `cowbell` class within the library, you don‚Äôt have to concern yourself with writing the functionality.

As in the example above, the addition of the `cowbell` class to `body` will give the entire document a **cowbell** color.

Now you‚Äôve used a CSS library!

Under the hood, this is the same way Bootstrap works. In the same manner, there exists a set of Bootstrap CSS classes that have been styled within the library.

All you need to do is learn the class names and apply them to your `html` markup. They‚Äôll do what they are designed to do.

In the case of the `**cowbell**` library, the class name required is¬†`.cowbell.`

What does it do? It gives the element a ‚Äúcowbell‚Äù color.

How does it work? You just go ahead and add the class name,¬†`.cowbell` to any element.

Likewise, the Bootstrap library has a giant CSS file with lots of utility classes, responsive modules, and general CSS goodies.

Let‚Äôs begin to peel the layers off Bootstrap in the next section.

### Installing Bootstrap

You can‚Äôt get Bootstrap to do anything if it is not installed or included within your webpage.

There are a couple ways to do this and more advanced users can explore the [available options](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/#package-managers).

For the sake of simplicity, I will be using a `cdn.`

Sorry about the jargon. A CDN is short for Content Delivery Network.

A simple way to describe what is CDN is to imagine placing an order for a pair of shorts from a fictitious website called Anazon. Your order was received and successfully processed by Anazon. Unfortunately, Anazon noticed you live in the Antartica‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomewhere really far from their main warehouse.

Bad news.

Fortunately, Anazon has a wide network of distributed warehouses all across the globe. Amazing.

Now, Anazon decides which warehouse is closest to your house in Antartica, and delivers your pair of shorts from that warehouse. Also, the next time you place an order, Anazon will check the same warehouse and deliver your goods in under 24hours.

How sweet.

This is kinda how a Content Delivery Network works. A CDN is like a warehouse that hosts common libraries like Bootstrap.

If you visit a website that has a link to a CDN resource, the Browser will load a cached version of the library. This is a version ‚Äòstored‚Äô in your Browser‚Äôs memory. If it finds none, it will make a request to fetch the requested resource.

Loading a resource from a CDN has the advantage of the resource being received faster. Like those pair of shorts!

Below is the link to the Bootstrap CDN.

    https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-/Y6pD6FV/Vv2HJnA6t+vslU6fwYXjCFtcEpHbNJ0lyAFsXTsjBbfaDjzALeQsN6M" crossorigin="anonymous"

Include that in your page, and you are good to go.

For example, add this to any HTML markup:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-/Y6pD6FV/Vv2HJnA6t+vslU6fwYXjCFtcEpHbNJ0lyAFsXTsjBbfaDjzALeQsN6M" crossorigin="anonymous">

### What Difference Does Bootstrap Make?

In this section we will go on to set up a basic demo page with Bootstrap. For these demos, I will be using [codepen.io](http://www.codepen.io).

Adding Bootstrap v4 to a project is simple. Click the CSS pen setting, and include Bootstrap from the options.






















Once that is done. we are all set up for the demos that come in the following sections.

So, what difference does Bootstrap make?





























The images show the results without Bootstrap (left), and with Bootstrap (right)







I have continued with the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù example we discussed earlier. Take a look at the results above.

The difference is very subtle. From the images you can see that some of Bootstrap‚Äôs default page styles have overridden those of the browser.

The font is now different, the spacing between each text block is altered, and the link has a different style.

Bootstrap at work!

Now that I‚Äôm sure you understand how CSS libraries work in general, let‚Äôs learn some of the basic Bootstrap Styles or class names that you should know.














### The Basic Bootstrap Styles Everyone Should¬†Know

Some very smart guys have put in a lot of work into building the Bootstrap library. They have done a lot of the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù work for you. All you have to do is plug into what they‚Äôve done and reap the fruits!

I will be using a question and answer method to explain the use of these Bootstrap styles.

Let‚Äôs get started.

To practice the concepts in this section, we will begin with the following markup. It‚Äôs an unintelligent poem about rabbits.

<pre name="ef94" id="ef94" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h1> Bunnie Poems </h1>  
<p> The following is a mostly unintelligent poem about Bunnies. Don't think too hard about them. <br /> Enjoy!  
</p></pre>

<pre name="2c45" id="2c45" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre"><h2> The Bunnie Who Had No Ears </h2></pre>

<pre name="e25c" id="e25c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre"><p> Mr Bunnie. How big the ears of your ancestors </p>  
<p> How fluffy the pride of your family </p>  
<p> But, wait... </p>  
<p> How is it that you have no ears </p>  
<p> With your eyes you hear, and your nose you see? </p>  
<p> How sad, Mr Bunny </p>  
<p> See him hop, hop, hop about on legs so very strong.</p>  
<p> But ears, he has none <p>  
<p> Live long, and make your ancestors proud </p></pre>

The result of the markup is seen below:












The initial result before the inclusion of Bootstrap.



The result is largely influenced by the Browser‚Äôs style. This is called the user agent stylesheet.

The first step is to go ahead and include Bootstrap. Please include Bootstrap as discussed in an earlier section, and you should have this:












The result after adding Bootstrap.



With no styles written yet, we have a decent looking page. It is well spaced, and the font family has changed. See the changes?

The Bootstrap default styles have overridden those of the Browser. Without any efforts, we have a decent looking page.

#### Why Did the Font Family Change when I added Bootstrap?

You may have noticed that the text is now displayed in a completely different font.

Bootstrap 4 embraces the idea of native font stacks. It‚Äôs pretty simple. Different Operating systems‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding Android, MacOS, Windows and Linux‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall have default fonts installed on them.

This version of Bootstrap sets up a font stack that uses the default sans-serif font available on the current device.












font stack illustration from the [complete practical introduction to¬†css](http://bit.ly/learn_css)



This is a much smarter thing to do, and without taking away the flexibility of change. You can override this behavior and use your own fonts.

I was planning to explain in great detail how setting native font stacks work in CSS, but [Marcin Wichary](https://medium.com/@mwichary) beat me to it. In this [article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/), he did a great job of explaining it better than I ever could.

So, by adding Bootstrap we have good looking fonts on all platforms‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääregardless of the device‚Äôs operating system.

#### How do I make headers that are bigger than the defaults?

Sometimes you need headers that are really big. For instance, at the top of a website.

Take a look at the basic example we set up earlier. There exists an `h1` and `h2` in their default sizes. If for some reason you need these headers to be bigger, Bootstrap 4 has you covered.

Add the any of the classes, `display-1` `display-2` `display-3` or `display-4.`

For example:

<pre name="ea04" id="ea04" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h2 class="display-4"> The Bunnie Who Had No Ears </h2></pre>

I have added the class `display-4` to the `h2` element. As seen below, it looks a lot bigger now. Bigger than the `h1` element!












‚ÄúThe Bunny who had no ears‚Äù appears bigger than the h1 element. Thanks to the ‚Äúdisplay-4‚Äù class¬†name.



#### Are the text display size classes restricted to only header elements?

The display classes are not restricted to just header elements, `h1` to `h6.` In fact, they can be added to any element.

In the example below, I have gone added to add `display-3` to one of the paragraph elements.

<pre name="7c1f" id="7c1f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="display-2"> But, wait... </p></pre>












The display classes may be used on any text elements‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just header elements (h1‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääh6)



#### What is the difference between the class names, `display-1` and `display-4`¬†?

The difference comes from the resulting size of the elements. `display-1` will yield bigger sizes than `display-4`¬†. You may see the difference in the sizes in the image below:












Which produces bigger texts? ‚Äúdisplay-1‚Äù or ‚Äúdisplay-4‚Äù¬†?



#### How do I center and justify text with Bootstrap?

Pretty simple. Add the `text-center` class to the desired element to center the text block.

<pre name="ab1e" id="ab1e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="text-center">How is it that you have no ears </p></pre>














To justify text, and style the text to fit along the left and right, use the `text-justify` class like so:

<pre name="54ed" id="54ed" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="text-justify">How is it that you have no ears </p></pre>

#### How do I capitalize texts in Bootstrap 4?

There are three classes specifically tailored to this cause:¬†`.text-lowercase`¬†,¬†`.text-uppercase` and¬†`.text-capitalize.`

If you apply the class `text-lowercase` on an already capitalized text, it will appear lower-cased.

<pre name="d766" id="d766" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="text-lowercase">WE BELIEVE IN YOU BUNNY</p></pre>

This will yield a lowercased text in spite of the text, _‚ÄúWE BELIEVE IN YOU BUNNY‚Äù_ written in caps.












‚Äúwe believe in you bunny‚Äù appears lower-cased despite being written in the HTML as¬†capitals



`text-capitalize` will capitalize the first letter of every word, and `text-uppercase` will capitalize every letter in a word.

#### How do I move texts to left or¬†right?

As in the other text utility classes, add any of the classes`text-left` and `text-right` for the desired effect.

#### How do I make a bold, normal or italic text with Bootstrap 4?

Adding the classes,`.font-weight-bold`,`.font-weight-normal` and  
`.font-italic` will make the text bold, normal or italic. If you‚Äôre coming from Bootstrap 3, you‚Äôll notice that these class names are different.

Here‚Äôs an example:

<pre name="fdbd" id="fdbd" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="font-weight-bold"> How sad, Mr Bunny </p>  
<p class="font-italic">See him hop, hop, hop about on legs so very strong.</p>  
 But ears, he has none </pre>












`font-weight-bold`,`font-weight-normal` and `font-italic in¬†action.`



Note that the example uses `font-weight-normal` on a `strong` tag. By default, `` should yield texts that are bold. This behaviour is ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù when you add the `font-weight-normal` class.

Note that the class name to make an italic text does NOT say `font-weight-italic` BUT `font-italic`

#### How can I style block quotes with Bootstrap?

Boostrap has the class name `blockquote` available for styling the block quote tag, `<blockquote>` or any other text block such as the paragraph element.

For example:

<pre name="e2c3" id="e2c3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><blockquote class="blockquote">  
  Men have ears. Men have Noses. Men have Mouths.We do too. We are Bunnies  
</blockquote></pre>

This will give the text, ‚ÄúMen have ears. Men have Noses. Men have Mouths.We do too. We are Bunnies‚Äù,a unique Bootstrap style for quotes.

#### How can I style the author of a quote differently in Bootstrap?

It is pretty common to include an author after a quote. The same goes for citing the source of any text block. To do this, use the `blockquote-footer` class like so:

<pre name="5bf7" id="5bf7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><blockquote class="blockquote">  
  Men have ears. Men have Noses. Men have Mouths.We do too. We are Bunnies  
  Ohans Bunny   
</blockquote></pre>

For this example, I have used `blockquote-footer` within a `blockquote` tag. This is not compulsory. You can use the `blockquote-footer` class name on any text block such as the paragraph element, `p.`

Below is the result of this:












The Bootstrap blockquote class names added to the quote and¬†author.



#### How do I remove the default padding, margin and style on an unordered list?

It seems that I always need to do this when I create any sort of `html` list. Again, this is trivially simple with Bootstrap. Use the `list-unstyled` class name, like so:

<pre name="784c" id="784c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><ul class="list-unstyled">  
  <li>Thank you</li>  
  <li>Muchas Gracias</li>  
  <li>Merci</li>  
</ul></pre>












The default style for lists‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith a dotted list style and some¬†padding.














The default view for the list has been altered. No dotted list style, and no¬†padding.



#### How do I create list items that are arranged side by¬†side?

Sometimes you may need your list items to be arranged horizontally,or side by side as opposed to the default vertical view. Use the class name `list-inline` on the unordered list, and `list-inline-item` on the list items.

For example:

<pre name="82f6" id="82f6" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><ul class="list-inline">  
  <li class="list-inline-item">Thank you</li>  
  <li class="list-inline-item">Muchas Gracias</li>  
  <li class="list-inline-item">Merci</li>  
</ul></pre>

This will created list items that are aligned side by side, horizontally.












The list now appears side by side, horizontally‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust as expected.



#### What color options are available in Bootstrap?

Colors are the visual language most people process before they even become aware of it.

In design and Bootstrap generally, colors may be applied to a wide range of elements. Texts, backgrounds, borders, and more.

Ask a 5 year old to name colors and they are off with, ‚Äúred, blue, green‚Ä¶‚Äù

There are well over 100 color names in CSS, which makes it difficult to represent all of these with class names. It‚Äôd be weird to have class names, `color-blue` `color-red`, on and on for over a 100 colors.

Hence, colors are treated a little differently in Bootstrap. There are certain keywords or special color names that are mapped to certain colors.

For example, the keyword `primary` is often associated with a blue color. `success` with a green color, and `danger` with a red color, and so on.












The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/) colors.



#### How do I display a colored text in Bootstrap?

To display a text in a certain color, you should use the¬†`.text-*` class names. where ‚Äò*‚Äô can be any of `primary` `secondary` `success` `danger` `warning` `info` `light` or `dark.`

For example:

    <p class="text-primary">Hello World</p><p class="text-secondary">Hello World</p><p class="text-success">Hello World</p><p class="text-danger">Hello World</p><p class="text-warning">Hello World</p><p class="text-info">Hello World</p><p class="text-light">Hello World</p><p class="text-dark">Hello World</p>

The code block above will yield the result shown below:












Varying text colors provided by Bootstrap



It is important to note that the applying the `text-light` class results in a text with a light color. It is mostly appropriate that you apply this class to texts on a dark background.

For example, I have gone ahead to use the `text-light` class on a text within a blue background. It displays nicely.












Use text-light on darker backgrounds. This way you‚Äôll get nice results‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreadable¬†texts.



#### How do I create Responsive Images in Bootstrap?

Everyone loves images. If you don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôre a part of the very few different ones. From experience, you must know that styling images can get out of hand very quickly.

To create images that are responsive regardless of the device being used, add the class¬†`.img-fluid` to the image element.

For example:

In the bunny poem example, I have added the image of a cute kitten:

<pre name="3fc3" id="3fc3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)"/></pre>

By default, the image extents arent seen because of the size of the image. Add the¬†`.img-fluid` class for a fully responsive image.

<pre name="fcbd" id="fcbd" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="img-fluid"/></pre>

#### How do I create subtle rounded images in Bootstrap?

Sometimes you want something different. So, Bootstrap allows for having images with subtle rounded borders. Just add the class `rounded` like so:

<pre name="fdd9" id="fdd9" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded"/></pre>

Note that the markup above has more than one class name applied to it. This is a good example of how to use multiple class names on a single element.

Look closely at the result below. You‚Äôll find the image having slightly round borders. Many times I find this more aesthetically pleasing than having square edges.












The cute kitten has been given subtle rounded edges for aesthetics.



#### Can I create images with just one side having a round¬†border?

In the previous example, the rounded corners were applied to all sides of the image. It is also possible to have rounded borders on just one direction. For example, applying the class `rounded-top` will create an image with only the top corners being rounded.¬†`.rounded-bottom` does the exact opposite.

<pre name="a498" id="a498" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded-top"/></pre>

Incase you were wondering, you can also use the `rounded-left` and `rounded-right` classes for `left` and `right` borders respectively.

#### Are there options for making images with a full circular background?

Yeah. Bootstrap allows for making a circular image by using the class name, `rounded-circle`.

For example:

<pre name="11c3" id="11c3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded-circle"/></pre>

This will result in a cute rounded kitten.












Cute rounded kitten with a fully round¬†border.



#### Can I manipulate the rounded edges bootstrap gives?

As much as possible, Bootstrap 4 tries not to take away your freedom. So yes, the rounded edges Bootstrap gives can be tweaked with your own styles. Let me show you an example.

If for some reason you have styled an image to have rounded borders, you can remove the rounded borders with Bootstrap by adding the `rounded-0` class.

For example:  
I have added a border radius of `50px` to the cat image:

<pre name="3212" id="3212" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">img {  
  border-radius: 50px  
}</pre>

Here‚Äôs the result:












The cute kitten with a border radius of¬†50px.



That‚Äôs a weird shaped cat image. Let‚Äôs see what is happening under the hood.

In the `html` markup, we have this:

<pre name="a141" id="a141" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded-bottom"/></pre>

As you can see from the markup, there‚Äôs already a `rounded-bottom` class applied to the image. Thus, bootstrap will have full control over the bottom edges. The edges you add using the `border-radius` property will affect only the top borders, or the borders you haven‚Äôt styled using Bootstrap.

Does that make sense? I guess it does.

If you took away the `rounded-bottom` class or any other `rounded` class on the image, your style will now take effect accross all sides of the border. See the result below:












The cute kitten now has all its sides obeying the CSS rule we just¬†wrote.



In the example above, the `rounded-bottom` class has been removed from the markup, leaving the borders to do your bidding.

Depending on your specific needs, you may take out all¬†`.rounded` classes provided by Bootstrap away from your markup and style the image yourself using the `border-radius` property.

If you‚Äôd like some of the edges to retain the default Bootstrap behavior, you may leave the specific rounded side class within your markup, such as`.rounded-top,` while styling the images using `border-radius` too.

#### How do I align images to the right or¬†left?

Alignment is a vital part of design. Most times you‚Äôll keep moving stuff around until it feels right.

To align images to the left or right, use any of the classes, `float-right` or `float-left.`

For example:

<pre name="711a" id="711a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="rounded-circle float-left"/></pre>












The bunny has been floated to to the left. It sits side by side with the text¬†now.



In order for the image to float to the desired direction, you need to remove the `img-fluid` class on the image, and give the image a fixed width like so:

<pre name="844f" id="844f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">img {  
  width: 150px  
}</pre>

The reason for that is `img-fluid` makes the image fill the available width of the device. It can‚Äôt move to the left or right of the screen as it already occupies all the space. You have to reduce the width of the image in your own CSS style sheet as I have done in the example above.

#### What‚Äôs the best way to style Images with text descriptions?

It is not impossible to have images with text descriptions. This is useful in galleries and other instances where you‚Äôre trying to pass more information about the image by using a text block.

The correct way to do this is to contain the images within a `figure` tag and have the text block within a `figcaption` block.

Below is an example:

<pre name="53a1" id="53a1" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
    My name is katey and I am only 2 and a half months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="a54e" id="a54e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
    
    My name is jando and I am only 3 months old. Clearly, I love to have fun!  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

And here‚Äôs the result of that:














Nothing magical yet. Now let‚Äôs style this.

Bootstrap allows for the use of two class names, `figure-img` and `figure-caption` As you may guessed, they are both used on the image and text block respectively.

Let me show you an example.

Go ahead and add the class names, `figure-img` and `figure-caption`like so:

<pre name="f7d2" id="f7d2" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
    My name is katey and I am only 2 and a half months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="9d06" id="9d06" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
    
    My name is jando and I am only 3 months old. Clearly, I love to have fun!  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

This will create some spacing between the image and the caption, and the text caption will be given a slightly calm color.

See the result below:














Note that to create the effect shown in the result above, I have added the class names `img-fluid` and `rounded` to the figure images. This will ensure that the images are responsive and have slightly rounded edges.

#### How do I center Images with Bootstrap?

Centering images can get a little tricky with Bootstrap. The first thing is to make sure that the image you‚Äôre trying to center hasn‚Äôt been styled to fit the available width or `100%`. You should remove the `img-fluid` class on the image if it exists.

Let‚Äôs see an example.

Below is a markup from an earlier example:

<pre name="1e84" id="1e84" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="rounded img-fluid"/></pre>

I‚Äôll take away the `img-fluid` class:

<pre name="7620" id="7620" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="rounded"/></pre>

And go ahead to style the image with my own class which will restrict the width of the image to perhaps, `200px`:

<pre name="3ad9" id="3ad9" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.img-restricted {  
  width: 200px  
}</pre>

This will yield the fixed width image you see below:












Image restricted to a width of 200px. By default it is aligned horizontally to the start of the page NOT the¬†center.



Now, to center the image.

There are two different ways to center images in Bootstrap.

1.  use the `text-center` class name
2.  use the `mx-auto` class name

These options work a little differently.

For the `text-center` class, the image to be centered must retain it‚Äôs default `display` value of `inline-block` or `inline`. Also, the class name must be added to the image parent block such as a `div` and NOT the image itself.

Sorry if that feels confusing. Let‚Äôs see an example.

<pre name="bd38" id="bd38" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**  
  <img src="**[**https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg**](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)**" class="rounded img-restricted"/>  
**</pre>

Note that the class name, `text-center` has been added to the parent `div` and NOT the `img` element.

And so, we have a centered image!












Centered image by applying text-center on a the image‚Äôs parent element and NOT the image¬†itself.



Just so you see what a wrong markup would look like, this is wrong:

<pre name="dde7" id="dde7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
</pre>

The markup is wrong because `text-center` has been applied to the `img` element. This will NOT center the image element.

Why does the `text-center` class work? Images are `inline-block` elements by default, so they will honor the `text-center` style applied on a parent element.

Let‚Äôs see the second way to center images using the `**mx-auto**` class.

If for some reason you changed the default `display` property of the image and made it `block`¬†, the `text-center` class will no longer work.

For example:

<pre name="f958" id="f958" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.img-restricted {  
   display: block  
}</pre>

Once you set the `display` property to `block`¬†, the image no longer honors the `text-center` style‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas it is no longer an `inline` element.
















Once the display property is set to block, the image goes back to its default position so it is NOT centered.







In this case, you have to center the image like every other block element. Apply the `mx-auto` class name to the `img` element like so:

<pre name="5328" id="5328" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg)" class="mx-auto rounded img-restricted"/></pre>

And the image comes back to being centered












And the image comes back to being centered. Aye!



Now you can go ahead and center whatever image you desire.

#### How do I add spacing on all sides of an¬†element?

This is new in Bootstrap 4, and I have found it to be super helpful. Many times you need to add extra `padding` or `margin` to an element. In previous versions, you‚Äôd have to do this by writing your own styles. Sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt work owing to specificity issues. All that has been taken care of in the latest version of Bootstrap.

The spacing Bootstrap gives ranges from¬†`.25rem` to `3rem`. For most use cases, this should be enough.

Assume margins are represented by the letter `m` and padding by the letter `p`¬†. Also, let the the different ranges be represented from `0 to 5.`

With that out of the way, you can add spacing on all sides of an element by using any of the `**m-***` classes for margins and `**p-***` for padding.

For example `**m-0**`**,** `**m-1**`**,** `**m-2**`**,** `**m-3**`**,** `**m-4**`and`**m-5**` are all valid class names for adding margins. The same may be said for adding padding using any of the following class names `**p-0**`**,** `**p-1**`**,** `**p-2**`**,** `**p-3**`**,** `**p-4**`and `**p-5.**`

Let‚Äôs see a practical example using an earlier example. Let‚Äôs add some spacing to the figure images and text caption we created earlier.

I will apply some padding to the `figure` element, like so:

<pre name="2960" id="2960" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is flerri and I am only 2 months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

What‚Äôs changed?

I haved added the class `p-5` that‚Äôs all that has changed. And the result?

See below:












A 3rem padding has been added to the first figure element. This was achieved by using the Bootstrap 4 class:¬†p-5.



As opposed to the other figures, you can see the first one has some padding as inner spacing added around all sides. Pretty cool!

Let‚Äôs go a step further and add the padding class `p-5` to all the figures:

<pre name="fe71" id="fe71" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is flerri and I am only 2 months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="2410" id="2410" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is katey and I am only 2 and a half months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="ea40" id="ea40" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is jando and I am only 3 months old. Clearly, I love to have fun!  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

Now we have all the figures having some extra spacing.












A 3rem padding has been added to all the figures. The class name p-5 has been used to achieve¬†this.



Pretty impressive result for little extra code.

#### How do I reduce or increase the spacing added on all sides of an¬†element?

In the previous example, I discussed that the class ranges were represented from `**0 to 5.**`

Zero, `0` will remove any spacing on an element, while the spacing increases as you go on from `1` to `5.`












Illustrating the size range for the space class¬†names



For example, the margin created by `**m-2**` will be smaller than that created by `**m-5**` Likewise, the padding created by `**p-1**` will be smaller than that created by `**p-3.**`

For the curious mind, `1` adds a spacing of `0.25rem`¬†, `2` adds a spacing of `0.5rem`¬†, `3` adds a spacing of `1rem`¬†, `4` adds a spacing of `1.5rem` and `5` adds a spacing of `3rem`¬†.












Spacing of each¬†class



To illustrate this¬†, I‚Äôll go ahead and add different spacing class names on the different figures like so:

<pre name="6e75" id="6e75" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is flerri and I am only 2 months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="4b42" id="4b42" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is katey and I am only 2 and a half months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="d491" id="d491" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is jando and I am only 3 months old. Clearly, I love to have fun!  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

Here‚Äôs the result of that.












The figures have different inner spacing. This is due to the different spacing class names added to the¬†markup.



In the result above, you can see the padding increase from the first figure to the third.

#### How do I add spacing to just ONE side of an¬†element?

There are times when you don‚Äôt want spacing on all sides of an element. You may only need some spacing at the `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right` of the element.

Bootstrap has all the options! That excites me. You‚Äôd be surprised how helpful this is when you begin to build stuff.

Instead of using the `m-*` class names, add a `t`¬†, `b`¬†, `l`¬†, or `r` for a `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right` margin.

For example, `mt-1`¬†, `mb-1`¬†, `ml-1` and `mr-1` are all valid class names. The range `**0**` to `**5**` still remains the same as before.












t is top. b is bottom. r is right. l is¬†left.



The `t`¬†, `b`¬†, `r` and `l` convention is also the same for padding.












t is top. b is bottom. r is right. l is left. even for¬†padding.



I‚Äôll go ahead to change the spacing we have on all the figures to represent `bottom` padding only.

<pre name="210b" id="210b" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is flerri and I am only 2 months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="57cc" id="57cc" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/126407/pexels-photo-126407.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is katey and I am only 2 and a half months old.  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

<pre name="b19f" id="b19f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">  
  <img src="[https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg](https://static.pexels.com/photos/416160/pexels-photo-416160.jpeg)" class="img-fluid rounded figure-img"/>  
    
    My name is jando and I am only 3 months old. Clearly, I love to have fun!  
  </figurecaption>  
</pre>

As you can see, I have used the `**pb-3**` class name. This will add bottom paddings of `1rem` each.














#### How do I add the same spacing to opposite sides of an¬†element?

So much for spacing. This is the last example ‚ÄîI promise.

It is also possible to add the spacing to say `top` and `bottom` sides of an element. In the same manner you may add the same spacing to the `left` and `right` of an element too.

So, how is this done?

Let `x` represent `left` and `right` values, while `y` represents `top` and `bottom` values.

To add the same spacing to both `left` and `right` sides of an element, use the `mx-*` class, and `my-*` class for both `top` and `bottom` values.

For example, `mx-1` will add a margin of `0.25rem` along the `left` and `right` sides of the element. `my-1` will add `0.25rem` along the `top` and `bottom` sides of the element.












If you didn‚Äôt skip math classes at school, the ‚Äòx‚Äô and ‚Äòy‚Äô naming convention shouldn‚Äôt feel so¬†strange.



And that is all for spacing! Trust me, it is important stuff.

#### How do I Style a Lead Paragraph?

The lead paragraph is usually the first paragraph in an essay or article. The aim is to hook the reader‚Äôs attention.

To style a lead paragraph, add the class¬†`.lead` to the paragraph. For example, I‚Äôll go ahead to add the class¬†`.lead` to the first paragraph of the Bunny Poem like so:

<pre name="1b6c" id="1b6c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="lead"> The following is a mostly unintelligent poem about Bunnies. Don't think too hard about them. <br /> Enjoy!  
</p></pre>

And the result is a slightly bigger paragraph as seen below:












a slightly bigger paragraph‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälead paragraph.



For the techies out there, the¬†`.lead` class bumps up the size of the font by `25%` and sets the `font-weight` to `300`¬†, resulting in a bigger and much lighter text tone.














### The Foundations of Responsive Design with Bootstrap

Have you used Flexbox before? If the answer to that is a yes, that‚Äôs great. With Flexbox, the flexbox formatting context is NOT initiated until a `flex-container` is created.

Whether you have some experience with Flexbox or not, with Bootstrap a `container` element has to be defined to reap the benefits of responsive design offered by Bootstrap.

#### So, what is a Bootstrap container¬†?

A container is simply an element with the¬†`.container` class applied to it. For example:

<pre name="f798" id="f798" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
</pre>

Pretty simple, huh?

For a simple markup, it is likely that you wrap every element in a bootstrap container.

For example, I‚Äôll refactor the Bunny Poem to use the Bootstrap container.

<pre name="4d71" id="4d71" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">    
  <h1> Bunnie Poems </h1>  
  <p class="lead"> The following is a mostly unintelligent poem about Bunnies. Don't think too hard about them. <br /> Enjoy!  
  </p></pre>

<pre name="1421" id="1421" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre"><h2 class="display-5"> The Bunnie Who Had No Ears </h2>  
  <p> Mr Bunnie. How big the ears of your ancestors </p>  
  <p> How fluffy the pride of your family </p>  
  <p class="display-4"> But, wait... </p>  
  <p class="text-center">How is it that you have no ears </p>  
  <p> With your eyes you hear, and your nose you see? </p>  
  <p class="font-weight-bold"> How sad, Mr Bunny </p>  
  <p class="font-italic">See him hop, hop, hop about on legs so very strong.</p>  
   But ears, he has none   
  <p> Live long, and make your ancestors proud </p>  
  <p class="text-capitalize">We believe in you</p>  
  <blockquote class="blockquote">  
    Men have ears. Men have Noses. Men have Mouths.We do too. We are Bunnies  
    Ohans Bunny   
  </blockquote>  
  ...  
</pre>

As you can see from the code sample above, I have now wrapped EVERY element in a div with the class of container.

<pre name="b1b5" id="b1b5" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    <!--every other element goes here -->  
</pre>

#### What is the difference between container and container-fluid?

In the example above, I did this:

<pre name="0fa3" id="0fa3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    <!--every other element goes here -->  
</pre>

While that is correct, there‚Äôs one more container class that Bootstrap makes available, and that is,¬†`.container-fluid.`

The usage is the same, like this:

<pre name="8b00" id="8b00" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    <!--every other element goes here -->  
</pre>

So what‚Äôs the difference?

Let‚Äôs see visual examples.

I always wondered why I didn't understand the difference between these when I started out learning the Bootstrap framework, years back. You‚Äôre in luck since I get it now. Let me explain it to you¬†:)

For visual feedback, I will go ahead and give the `body` a `red` background color. I will also give `container` and `container-fluid` background colors of `white`. Just so they don‚Äôt inherit the `red` background color from `body.`

Here‚Äôs the code:

<pre name="6fbc" id="6fbc" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">body {  
  background: red  
}  
.container,  
.container-fluid {  
  background: white  
}</pre>

Now, let‚Äôs see what difference it makes when you wrap all the content of the bunny poem in a¬†`.container` div.

With all the content of bunny poem wrapped within a¬†`.container` div, try to resize your browser.

What do you notice?












The expected behavior on resizing the¬†browser.



You will notice that the¬†`.container` width changes at different viewports. It leaves some breathing space between the itself and the `body` element‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis explains why you see see the `red` background in the gif above. Don‚Äôt forget the `body` element has a `red` background.

Simple as it may seem, this is a very important behavior to note.

On the contrary, if you used¬†`.container-fluid`¬†, the div fills up the available viewport. You don‚Äôt see the red background as there is no breathing space between the `container-fluid` element and the `body`. All the available space has been occupied.












The expected behavior on resizing the¬†browser.



As you can see, with the¬†`.container-fluid` class you don‚Äôt have the luxury of space. The container takes up `100%` of the available width. There‚Äôs still a small padding applied to the¬†`.container-fluid` element, but the width doesn‚Äôt grow bigger or change with the user‚Äôs viewport. This is the difference between the¬†`.container` and¬†`.container-fluid` class names.

#### What are Media¬†Queries?

Since this section is focused on responsive design, I think it is important to have a refresher on what media queries are‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially for beginners. The section is also vital to understanding how the responsive modules in Bootstrap works.

Consider the code block below:

<pre name="a827" id="a827" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**@media screen and (min-width: 768px)** {  
     .bg {  
         background-color: blue  
     }  
}</pre>

If you‚Äôre familiar with writing responsive modules by hand, then the code block above should be familiar.

The code block represents the use of CSS media queries. If you have no idea how that works, please read on.

Media queries are at the heart of responsive design. They let you target specific screen sizes and specify codes to be run on the specified devices alone.

The most popular form in which media queries are used is something called the `**@media**` rule.

It looks like this:

<pre name="ea9d" id="ea9d" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**@media screen and (min-width: 300px)** {  
  /*write your css in this code block*/  
}</pre>

Looking at it, you can almost guess what that does.  
_‚Äú_For a screen device with a minimum width of 300px¬†‚Ä¶ do this and that ‚Äù

Any styles within the code block will only apply to devices that match the expression, ‚Äú `screen and (min-width: 300px)`_.‚Äù_ In the example above, the device width `300px` is known as a breakpoint.

I guess that helped clear up some confusion.

#### What is the Bootstrap Grid¬†System?

With Bootstrap or any well-thought-out design, nothing just sits on the page. Every element sits on a well defined grid structure.



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xvY4HjLZYY9P0eHiJGItRA.png)

Example grid



In this context, a grid is a series of intersecting vertical and horizontal guide lines used to structure content on a web page.

Nobody just slap content haphazardly on a page.
















web content poorly laid out on a¬†grid.







See the example above. Ever seen a content on a website arranged like that? I bet ‚Äúno‚Äù.

Most of the time, you will have a grid that contains well structured content. Something like this:
















Thoughtfully laid out content along a¬†grid







Bootstrap has a way to define grids and rightly place content on it too. This is what is called the Bootstrap grid system.

For more advanced users, It is important to note that you don‚Äôt need horizontal or vertical grid lines. With the [CSS Grid](https://medium.com/flexbox-and-grids/how-to-efficiently-master-the-css-grid-in-a-jiffy-585d0c213577) sprinkled with some CSS magic, you can easily build a non-conventional layout.

#### How do I use the Bootstrap Grid?

The Bootstrap 4 grid is built with Flexbox‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich makes it even more powerful than ever before.

Fair warning: this part of Bootstrap tends to suck when you first learn it. But, if you take the time to master the Bootstrap grid system, you‚Äôll find it to be one of the most important Bootstrap knowledge you have.

Let me explain how it works.

So, your friend Chloe calls you at midnight and says, _‚Äú_I‚Äôm gonna get married!..haha_‚Äù_

You both get excited about the news and chat for longer than you expected. Just when you were going to end the call, you decide to act like a cool heaven-sent developer. _‚Äú_Hey, Chloe. I‚Äôm going to build your wedding website for you!_‚Äù_ And you guys chatter for another 30 minutes‚Ä¶

Well, sweet story.

Good news is, you just made Chloe‚Äôs night. She‚Äôll be super excited. Bad news, or (not so bad news) is you‚Äôre going to spend the time and energy, (and some coffee) to build the wedding site.

So, you get a mockup like this one:












I designed this hastily for the purpose of this article. So, don‚Äôt go about criticizing it¬†:)



You don‚Äôt have a lot of time to build this site, so you resort to using Bootstrap. What‚Äôs the first thing to do? Set up the Bootstrap grid.

There are some pretty strict rules to follow while using the Bootstrap grid system.

First, in your mind‚Äôs eye scroll back up to the mockup above and try to break out each line of content into separate rows. This line of content should run from the horizontal to the vertical.

Can you do that?

I have gone ahead to do the same, and here‚Äôs the result:














What I have done is to draw horizontal boxes extending from left to right around grouped content along a line. Even for more involved layouts, this sort of breakdown is very important.

These horizontal boxes are called **rows**. Denoted by the class¬†`.row`

It doesn't end here. Within each row there are individual boxes of content. See the previous image and try to identify these individual boxes of content.

Again, I have done the same. See the results below:














These individual boxes of content that live within rows are called **columns**.

Makes sense?

Columns are denoted by the class¬†`.col`

Since rows and columns are great buddies, a column should not exist outside a row. That‚Äôs an important rule to remember.

Also, every row must be placed within a container. Either¬†`.container` or¬†`.container-fluid` will do. A row cannot exist outside a container. It must live within a container.

In practice, you may have an overall container that houses the entire group of rows, like so:












a single container (in red) that houses all¬†rows.



Or you may have a container that wraps around each individual row, like this:












Multiple containers that house each row of¬†content.



I seem to favor the latter. I find it more flexible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin certain use cases.

A quick summary: Every row must be placed within a container. Rows are specified with the class name¬†`.row`¬†, columns with¬†`.col` and containers with either¬†`.container` or¬†`.container-fluid`.

This is the foundation of how the Bootstap grid system works. I‚Äôll be discussing some more practical use cases in the coming sections.

#### What About Columns of Different Sizes?

As you build web apps, it is very likely that you will need columns of different widths. Almost every time, there‚Äôll be columns of varying widths within rows.

Below is an example:














A column may take up `60%` width of the row, and the other `40%`. How do you deal with this using the Bootstrap grid?

The Bootstrap grid assumes a 12 column grid. It assumes that within every row, there exists 12 columns available. With these 12 columns, it becomes your duty to distribute the width of the columns whichever way you deem fit.

Let me explain.

As shown earlier, consider the row of content below:














The row contains two columns of different sizes.

Within this row, the bootstrap grid assumes 12 columns within this row, like so:












The bootstrap 12 column grid illustrated.



According to Bootstrap, there are 12 columns within every row. How you distribute the space is up to you.

Since you have only 2 user-defined columns (the bigger and smaller column) within the row, you‚Äôve got to distribute the column space, like so:












Distribute the 12 Bootstrap columns amongst your user defined¬†columns.



It‚Äôs pretty simple, and in no time you‚Äôll get used to this. You assign 8 of the columns to the bigger column, and the remaining 4 to the smaller column. Note that the sum of this equals 12.

The sum of the width of distributed columns within a row must not be greater than 12\. In the example above, we used `col-8` and `col-4`. The `col-8` represents the bigger column that takes up 8 bootstrap grid columns, and `col-4` represents the smaller column with 4 bootstrap grid columns.

In this case, you will have two columns with one being `2x` the width of the other. Remember, `8 / 4 = 2¬†.`

If you wanted columns of equal width, you‚Äôd use `col-6` and `col-6`¬†. This will create equal columns which take up half of the `12` Bootstrap grid columns.

If you wanted a bigger ratio between the two columns, you may use `col-10` and `col-2`¬†.

I‚Äôm pretty sure you get it now.

#### What if I exceed 12¬†columns?

In the event that you have a total number of columns that exceed 12, they‚Äôll wrap unto the next line. Just like using `flex-wrap`

For example:

<pre name="0d6b" id="0d6b" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
      
    
</pre>

With the markup above, the total number is 12\. You get the expected result below:












4 columns within a¬†row



If within the same row you add 2 more columns, what happens?

<pre name="dda3" id="dda3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
      **  
        
        
      **  
      
    
</pre>

The next set of columns after 12 is wrapped unto the next line, like so:












The next set of columns wrap unto the next¬†line.



#### This is good, but what about Responsive Grids?

In the examples above, the column sizes defined will remain the same regardless of the user‚Äôs device.

For example, `col-8` and `col-4` will create 2 columns within the row. This will be the case on mobile devices, and larger devices.

For the sake of responsive design, this will rarely be the case. If you have a 2 column grid on tablet devices, you may want the columns to stack up on mobile.












Two side by side columns displayed on larger devices. Each of the column takes up half of the available width.














The two columns now stack vertically on mobile. Each of the columns also take up 100% of the available width.



You may also have a 3 column grid on desktop devices, but 2 on tablet devices or only 1 column on mobile devices. In this case, there‚Äôs got to be a way to hide the extra columns we do not want on smaller devices.

Luckily, bootstrap has these use cases covered!

The Bootstrap columns may be modified using certain modifiers.¬†  
For instance:

`col-**sm**` refers to a column on small devices (phones) and above

`col-**md**` refers to a column on medium devices (tablets) and above

`col-**lg**` refers to a column on large devices (desktops) and above

`col-**xl**` refers to a column on extra large (wide screen) devices












Screenshot from getbootstrap.com



Let‚Äôs go back to the example of a 2 column width. We need the columns to appear as 2 columns on medium devices (and larger), but stack horizontally on smaller devices (phones).

How do you do this?

Begin with a markup like so:

<pre name="099c" id="099c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
      
</pre>

I have assumed that this `row` will be placed within a container. Remember, every `row` must be placed within a `container`.

Bootstrap employs a mobile first philosophy. By default you should build the design for mobile devices, then move up to bigger devices from there.

In that case, we‚Äôll deal with the display on mobile devices first.

<pre name="eb38" id="eb38" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
      
</pre>

The markup above will create columns that take up all the available width within the row. The columns will stack vertically with a 100% width.

This isn‚Äôt the behaviour we want for medium devices, so we add the modifier classes, like so:

<pre name="1ef0" id="1ef0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
      
</pre>

You see that?

Note that for the smallet of devices, there‚Äôs no need for a modifier class.

Now, for medium devices and larger the row will assume a 2 column width. One taking up 6 columns and the other takes 6 columns, with the Bootstrap 12 column grid.

In the practical section, I‚Äôll discuss how to hide columns on smaller devices.

#### How did that¬†work?

Bootstrap has implemented media queries with certain breakpoints to meet every responsive need. Ranging from extra small phones to small phones, tablets, laptops and even bigger desktops‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBootstrap has you covered.

Like the margin and padding classes we studied earlier, there is a specific naming convention to applying styles based on the specific screen size of the user.












Screenshot from getbootstrap.com



As seen in the image above, `xs` refers to extra small phones, `sm` refers to small phones, `md` refers to medium devices such as tablets, `lg` refers to large devices such as laptops, and `xl` refers to extra large screens such as large desktop screens.

For the curious mind, here‚Äôs what the Bootstrap media queries look like:

    // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)// No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

If you‚Äôre an advanced user, take a look at the docs for [version4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) and [version3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid). Note the difference in the grid breakpoints. I spent some time figuring this out myself. So, go do the same.

#### What‚Äôs the deal with `min-width`?

You‚Äôll notice that the Bootstrap media queries use `min-width`¬†. You‚Äôd also notice that in previous examples I kept saying, ‚Äúmedium devices and larger‚Äù

For example, `col-md` targets medium devices and larger. So, if you specify a column to take up 8 columns on medium devices, `col-md-8` other devices larger than medium will also take up the same width definition. There‚Äôs no need to write `col-lg-8` or `col-xl-8`

This behavior is owing to the use of `min-width` within the Bootstrap media queries.

    // Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

The code block above says, ‚Äúfor devices that have a minimum width of `768px`¬†‚Ä¶‚Äù. This embodies every device larger than `768px` too.

#### Can I customize the Bootstrap classes based on specific screen¬†sizes?

Yes, this can be done, but not for every Bootstrap class. Let‚Äôs take styling texts for example. If you wanted a bit of text to appear to the center only on mobile phones, how would you do that?

Use the class, `text-sm-center` on the text block:

<pre name="8aa6" id="8aa6" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="text-sm-center">How is it that you have no ears </p></pre>

The text, ‚ÄúHow is that you have no ears‚Äù will appear normal in the document flow, except when viewed by a small phone. At this point, it will be centered across the screen.

### Summary

This has been a pretty enlightening section. If you‚Äôre new to Bootstrap, you should be a lot more comfortable with how the framework works now. If you‚Äôre an old hat, then you‚Äôve probably seen new ways this version of Bootstrap differs from the former.

In the coming section, we will go practical. We will display every other technique, trick and new goodies in the framework with practical examples.

As discussed in the ‚ÄúWhat You‚Äôll Learn‚Äù section, we will go ahead and start building the Startup Home Pag_e_.














### **Getting Practical with Bootstrap 4**

Haha! This is the part of the article that gets me really excited. In the earlier sections, I tried to get you comfortable with the Bootstrap 4 framework, now let‚Äôs build some really cool projects.

When we are finished with [this project](https://codepen.io/ohansemmanuel/full/zEKrxP/), you should have successfully built the a single page Startup Page.

#### What you will¬†learn

As well as being the first real world application of the concepts taught in this article, building this project has some advantages.

If you‚Äôre new to Bootstrap, I made sure to touch up on the fundamental concepts you need. For more experienced developers, this example highlights some of the new features of Bootstrap 4.

The example also shows how Flexbox is used in Bootstrap 4\. Also, some seemingly simple things such as offsetting columns and aligning block elements to the center are handled differently in this version of the framework.

These are a few of the things we will be looking at in this example.

#### What you need to follow¬†along

For the sake of a rapid development set up, I‚Äôll be using [CodePen](https://codepen.io) for this demo. That‚Äôs all you need to follow along.

To start we will focus on the initial viewport of the Startup Home Page. It fills up the screen with a decent background image, a text block and a CTA (Call To Action) button.












initial viewport



Also, since we will be focusing on a mobile first approach, it is important to see how the design views on mobile devices.

Below is the mobile mockup:














As seen in the image above, everything is pretty much the same.The CTA and opening paragraph stay horizontally aligned to the start of the page.

Now that we understand the design requirements, let‚Äôs get started with the initial markup required.

#### The initial¬†markup

If working locally, the initial markup you need for a decent bootstrap project is this:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">  <head>    <!-- Required meta tags -->    <meta charset="utf-8">    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-/Y6pD6FV/Vv2HJnA6t+vslU6fwYXjCFtcEpHbNJ0lyAFsXTsjBbfaDjzALeQsN6M" crossorigin="anonymous">  </head>

      <body>       </body></html>

Don‚Äôt let the seemingly complex code turn you off. The markup is quite basic.

First, consider the `meta` tag:

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

The `meta` tag exists to ensure that the pages developed are displayed correctly on mobile devices. If you define media queries without this `meta` tag, you may not get the look you were hoping for on mobile devices. It is important you have it included. The tag also ensures that touch zooming is accounted for on mobile devices.

Curous what the `content` and `initial-scale` attributes do? See this well explained [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33767533/what-does-the-shrink-to-fit-viewport-meta-attribute-do).

Secondly, consider the `link` tag:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-/Y6pD6FV/Vv2HJnA6t+vslU6fwYXjCFtcEpHbNJ0lyAFsXTsjBbfaDjzALeQsN6M" crossorigin="anonymous">

The `link` tag above is the same as any other `link` tags you‚Äôve used in the past. It includes the `href` attribute that points to the bootstrap `cdn`.

Okay, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. What are the`integrity` and `crossorgin` html attributes?














The `integrity` attribute checks the source from which the `cdn` is loaded and ensures that the file hasn‚Äôt been manipulated. It is a security measure to ensure you‚Äôre getting what you ‚Äúordered‚Äù. This may seem trivial, but for a long time a prevalent disadvantage to using a CDN was that you had no direct control over what was in the content provided. This could lead to having unreliable or tampered imported code.

The `crossorigin` attribute is present when a request is loaded using ‚ÄòCORS‚Äô.

Do not think too hard about what these attributes are. Let‚Äôs keep going.

At this point it is safe to assume that you have the basic markup setup. Also, note that the markup above doesn‚Äôt contain any links to a JavaScript file. This is intentional. Further down this article, we may take a look at adding interactivity using JavaScript much later.

#### Codepen Setup

I‚Äôll be using codepen for an easier setup. In the codepen,you can add the meta tags in the `html` settings pop up. Please refer to the screenshot below.












add the meta and link tag in the ‚ÄúStuff for <head>‚Äù¬†section



In your `html` go ahead and kick things off with this:

<pre name="20eb" id="20eb" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h1>Hello World</h1></pre>

If you have _‚Äú_Hello World_‚Äù_ displayed on the screen then you‚Äôre ready to follow along without any glitches.

#### Initial Document Structure

One of the perks of a new API is that there are really no best practices in its early stages of coverage. The same may be said for Bootstrap 4.

If you‚Äôve worked with Bootstrap in the past then you know that your project markup can get difficult to manage in no time. For this reason, I have some patterns that work well for me. You do not need to adopt them, but they can certainly make your work easier. Try them.

When you take a look at the [final design](https://codepen.io/ohansemmanuel/full/zEKrxP/), you will realize that there are categorized sections of content.

There‚Äôs an initial section with a call to action, a section with the app mockup, a section that highlights some of the features of the business, a testimonial section, and more. You get the gist. In all you should have 8 sections.

The first rule of thumb is to have separate layers of content using a `section` tag or any other semantic `html5` tag. Why? By design, using Bootstrap means you‚Äôll have a lot of `div`s in your markup. Using the `section` tag makes the markup a little more manageable.

<pre name="5a10" id="5a10" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  
  
  
  
  
  
</pre>

You should start with 8 tags as shown above.

Now, give each tag a unique `id`¬†.

The reason I choose `id` over classes has to do with specificity and having a unique identifier. You‚Äôll come to see why this is important later.

I‚Äôll go ahead and name the `section` elements with relevant IDs

<pre name="242d" id="242d" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
  
  
  
  
  
  
</pre>

Now we have 8 `section` tags ready to be put to good use.

#### Building the Initial¬†viewport

Let‚Äôs analyze and build the initial section `section#introduction`














What we have is a `section` that fills the initial viewport of the user, with a message and call to action (CTA) vertically centered and horizontally aligned to the start of the `section`.

Now let‚Äôs apply the knowledge of grids to the project being built.












The initial section as viewed on multiple¬†devices



The initial viewport will have its internal markup structured like this:

<pre name="3482" id="3482" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
     
      
         
      
     
</pre>

Now, we have a basic structure in place.

Note the use of the column class,¬†`.col-12` This ensures that the `div` fills the entire available 12 columns. Adding the class,¬†`.col-12` means that at every screen size, big or small, the `div` will always fill the entire 12 column grid. It will be full width across the grid.

The markup needed within the `div.col-12` is this:

<pre name="5a17" id="5a17" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h1>Coding on steroids</h1>  
<p>Stop hiring engineers to write your code. Just use the 1kb script that magically solves all your problems and algorithms.</p>  
Try it yesterday</pre>

What you should have now is a bare page that doesn‚Äôt look any good.














#### Let‚Äôs make this¬†pretty

There are a couple of things we need to make this UI great.

(i) Style the `section#introduction  
section#introduction` needs a background image and is required to fill the user‚Äôs viewport

(ii) Rightly position the content block  
The content block, the text blocks, `h1` and `p` containing _‚Äú_Coding on Steroids‚Ä¶‚Äù must be perfectly aligned vertically to the center

(iii) Style the Header and Lead paragraph  
The `h1` and `p` elements need some styling‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno matter how basic

(iv) Style the CTA¬†  
Call to actions should be legible and distinct.  
The `button` element should also be styled too

(iv) Extend beyond mobile view  
Finally, on bigger screens, the content block should NOT fill the available width but take up `50%` of the available width

With these in mind, we will solve these problems with the least amount of custom styles, taking advantage of the default Bootstrap styles where possible.

Let‚Äôs get started.

#### Solutions

To style `section#introduction` with a background image, you need to write some custom style, like this:

<pre name="6d90" id="6d90" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">#introduction {  
  background: linear-gradient(rgba(100,181,246 ,1), rgba(0,0,0,0.8)), url('[http://bit.ly/2fBj6OJ'](http://bit.ly/2fBj6OJ%27)) 0% 0%/cover   
}</pre>

This will give the `section#introduvtion` a subtle background image topped with a mild linear gradient.

If you‚Äôre not sure what the code above does, the following illustration may help:












An example of setting a gradient and background image on an¬†element.



It is required that the `section#introduction` fills the user‚Äôs viewport. Bootstrap does not have a utility class for this purpose, so we need to write ours. Here it is:

<pre name="2a55" id="2a55" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.fill-viewport {  
  min-height: 100vh   
}</pre>

Now, add this class to `section#introduction` like so:

<pre name="ce01" id="ce01" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       ...  
     
   
</pre>

What have I done here?

You‚Äôll notice that I have added the¬†`.fill-viewport` to the `div.row` NOT the overall container, `div.container` or the `section#introduction.`

This is very intentional. As a rule of thumb, every utility class you need on a containing content body should go in the¬†`.row` except in certain special occasions. This is how I like to work. One other reason I follow this rule is that it makes the markup neat, without having class names jumping around everywhere. You need a bit of structure to write good code.

With that you should have a `section` that looks pretty good.














You must have noticed that the content block isn‚Äôt well positioned. Let‚Äôs have it in the vertical center of the page.

Here‚Äôs the perfect place to point this out. Every Bootstrap 4¬†`.row` is by default a `flex-container.`

I cannot overemphasise how important this is.

Every Bootstrap 4¬†`.row` is by default a `flex-container.`

This opens up opportunities that weren't available in previous versions of the framework.

Since`.row` is a `flex-container` we can go ahead to add the Bootstrap utility class `align-items-center` This will align the content of every `flex-container` to the center.

Apply it like this:

<pre name="6ee0" id="6ee0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       ...  
     
   
</pre>

Again, I have added this class to the¬†`.row`¬†.

Below is the result of that:














At this point, we are making decent progress.

Bootstrap 4 has many other [Flexbox utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/) classes. They barely need a lot of explanations. The class names are very descriptive.

Let‚Äôs style the `h1` and `p` elements.

I had taken the time the discuss text utility classes early in this article. To style these text elements, do this:

<pre name="41ae" id="41ae" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h1 **class="text-white"**>Coding on steroids</h1>  
<p **class="lead"**>Stop hiring engineers to write your code. Just use the 1kb script that magically solves all your problems and algorithms.</p></pre>

As you already know, `text-white` will give the `h1` a white color,¬†`.lead` will style the paragraph a little differently from other paragraphs.














This looks good, but I want the paragraph to have a slighly faintier color. For this purpose, we will write another utility class:

<pre name="1f35" id="1f35" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**.text-white-70** {  
  color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)  
}</pre>

This will give the text a slightly transparent white color.

Go ahead and use this class on the lead paragraph like this:

<pre name="9b9b" id="9b9b" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><p class="lead **text-white-70**">Stop hiring engineers to write your code. Just use the 1kb script that magically solves all your problems and algorithms.</p></pre>

And now you should have this:














Note how we are abstracting tiny functionalities into reusable CSS classes. This is really important for reusability.

The button is still unstyled. We need to fix that.

Buttons in Bootstrap are styled using the¬†`.btn` class. There are a few variations with respect to color. For example`.btn-primary` and¬†`.btn-secondary` will give a blue and gray button respectively.












[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/)



To style the link¬†, do this:

<pre name="fa3e" id="fa3e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">Try it yesterday</pre>














At this point, we have a `section` that looks good on mobile, but not so great on larger devices. Let‚Äôs fix that.

Bootstrap follows the widely accepted mobile first approach to development. This means you build for mobile devices first, then you adapt the design to even larger screen sizes. This is what we will now do.

When defining the containing grid within the `section#introduction` we did just that.

<pre name="8dba" id="8dba" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   ....  
</pre>

By writing this, we said _‚Äú_Oh Bootstrap, let this `div` fill up the entire 12 column width on all screen sizes._‚Äù_ This is good‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the spirit of designing from a mobile first perspective.

Now let‚Äôs have the column take up half of the width on larger devices. You do this like so:

<pre name="3be0" id="3be0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">   
    ...  
</pre>

Now what we‚Äôve said is this: _‚Äú_Oh Bootstrap, by default, let this div fill up the entire 12 column width, BUT let the div take up 6 columns on larger devices._‚Äù_

12 halved, equals 6\. Hence, the column will take up half of the available space on larger devices.














That wraps up the development of the initial viewport.

Let‚Äôs move on to the next section.

#### Building the startup details¬†section

The next section is quite interesting. Below is how it views on big, medium and small devices:














On mobile devices, the user is shown a full width column with important bit of texts. On tablet devices, more text is shown, and an app preview by the side. This makes for 2 equal width columns.

On larger devices, even more text is displayed, and the mobile app preview remains too.

Now, let‚Äôs build this.

By convention, we will take a mobile first design. Design for mobile devices first.

Fill the `section#info--1` with the following markup:

<pre name="bd9a" id="bd9a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
        
        <h6 class="text-uppercase text-black-40">  
          million dollar info  
        </h6>  
        <h2>We do what our competitors do, but with 500% more</h2>  
        <p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error  
        sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium,  
        totam rem aperiam..</p>  
       
      
    
</pre>

You‚Äôd notice that I snugged in a lot more here. Let me explain

Consider the¬†`.row`:

<pre name="d687" id="d687" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"></pre>

Within the `row` there is a column represented by:

<pre name="d4e8" id="d4e8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">...</pre>

`col-12` ensures that the `div` spans the full width, 12 columns by default.

There are two additional classes within the¬†`.row` you should be familiar with. `pt-5` adds a padding top to the `div` and `align-items-center` ensures that the flex-items are centered vertically.

Do not forget that in Bootstrap 4, every `row` is a `flex-container.`

The following code block represent the text blocks:

<pre name="d7b8" id="d7b8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><h6 class="text-uppercase text-black-40">million dollar info</h6>  
<h2>We do what our competitors do, but with 500% more</h2>  
 <p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem  accusantium doloremque laudantium,totam rem aperiam..</p></pre>

`text-uppercase` is a bootstrap utility class for making the text appear capitalized.

`text-black-40` is another tiny class that gives the text a color of black with a `40%` opacity.

<pre name="6242" id="6242" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**.text-black-40** {  
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)  
}</pre>

And with that you should have this:














Looks good on mobile. Now let‚Äôs fix the display on bigger devices.

For medium devices, we need two columns. One to house the app mockup, and the other the text block.

The code block below highlights the solution. Go ahead and add the image in a new column just within the¬†`.row` but above the text block.

<pre name="b168" id="b168" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
       **  
         **<img src="**[**http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS**](http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS)**" class="img-fluid"/>**  
      ** **  
         
        <h6 class="text-uppercase text-black-40">  
          million dollar info  
        </h6>  
        <h2>We do what our competitors do, but with 500% more</h2>  
        <p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error  
        sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium,  
        totam rem aperiam..</p>  
       
      
    
</pre>

The new code block that includes the image is this:

<pre name="ff3a" id="ff3a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    <img src="[http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS](http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS)" class="img-fluid"/>  
</pre>

There are a couple new Bootstrap utility classes in there. Let‚Äôs have a look.

Class names begining with a `d-` represent display classes.

`d-none` will hide any element to which it is applied, while `d-block` will show the element by giving it a `display: block` Thus, applying the classes `d-none` and `d-md-block` says, _‚Äú_Hey Bootstrap, hide this element by default, but display the element on medium `md` devices_.‚Äù_

Also, `align-self-end` will make sure that the element is aligned to the bottom of the flex container vertically. Some Flexbox goodies there!

There‚Äôs one more change you may not have noticed.

We now have 2 columns each with the class name¬†`.col` Instead of having the two columns have the class name, `col-12` change this to just¬†`.col`

<pre name="1d3f" id="1d3f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
       **  
         <img src="[http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS](http://bit.ly/2fyUtlS)" class="img-fluid"/>  
         
       ****  
        <h6 class="text-uppercase text-black-40">  
          million dollar info  
        </h6>  
        <h2>We do what our competitors do, but with 500% more</h2>  
        <p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error  
        sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium,  
        totam rem aperiam..</p>  
       
      
    
</pre>

When you have any number of elements having the¬†`.col` class, they will occupy the available width in equal dimensions.

In this case, the image block and the content area will occupy `50%` of the available width. If you had three elements within a¬†`.row` with each having the class¬†`.col`¬†, they will each take up `30%` of the available width. Pretty sure you understand it now.

Here‚Äôs the result you should have at this point:














We‚Äôre almost done with this `section` apart from the additional text blocks on larger devices. Let‚Äôs fix that.

Since columns can be nested, we can include another column to house the side by side text block on large devices.

This should go inside the second column, and beneath the last text block:

<pre name="90b5" id="90b5" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><!-- columns can be nested -->  
   
     
      <h5>killer feature</h5>  
       <p>veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae  
       dicta sunt explicabo.</p>  
       learn more  
      
      
       <h5>second killer feature</h5>  
        <p>veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae  
        dicta sunt explicabo.</p>  
        learn more  
      
 </pre>

You‚Äôll notice the use of the display utility classes again. By default, both `div` within the `row` are hidden with `d-none` Hence they wont display on mobile devices. The class name `col` ensures they both take equal spaces. However, the second text block will only be shown on larger devices with¬†`.d-lg-block`.

Since Bootstrap employs a mobile first approach by design, the first text block with the class of `d-md-block` will also be visible on large devices.

‚Äúshow on mobile‚Äù is synonymous to ‚Äúshow on all devices‚Äù.  
‚Äúshow on medium devices‚Äù also means ‚Äúshow on medium devices and everything else larger‚Äù.

I really hope you understood this.

Here‚Äôs the result so far:














Let‚Äôs move on to the next section!

#### Building the about¬†section

The third section has pretty much the same vibe as the second section I discussed above. There are a few subtle differences:

1.  The use of `pre` tags
2.  A change in the order of the columns when displayed on mobile devices.












The code block appears first when viewed on mobile. On larger devices, the display is swapped with the code block appearing last.



Here is the entire code that makes up the section:

<pre name="b5e4" id="b5e4" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       
       <p class="text-uppercase text-white-40"></p>  
       <h2 class="text-white">Coding has never been this fast. It's almost magical</h2>  
       <p class="lead text-white-70">Stop hiring engineers to write your code. Just install one script that magically solves all your problems.</p>  
       Read the docs  
       
     <pre class="col-12 col-md-6 my-5 **order-1 order-md-2** py-4 border border-info rounded text-info">  
          
        
         const data = {  
              "purpose": {  
              "getId": "#element",  
              "companyName": "coolStartup",  
            }  
          }  
             
         function codingSteroids(    
             data,  
             getSteroidsType  
         )   
             
         function getSteroidsType() {  
           return "codeHellish!"  
         }  
      </pre>  
     
   
</pre>

You may be tempted to think the code block represented above is complex stuff. Yet on close investigation, it really isn‚Äôt.

As always, the section begins with a familiar markup:

<pre name="a1bf" id="a1bf" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
     ...  
     
   
</pre>

I always give the sections an `Id` Also, within the `row` exists two columns:

<pre name="f9c3" id="f9c3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       
     <pre class="**col-12"**  
     </pre>  
     
   
</pre>

By default, both columns have been set up to take up all 12 available columns. Hence, they will stack against each other vertically.

On medium devices and larger, the columns take up equal column width:

<pre name="53a7" id="53a7" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       
     <pre **class="**col-12 **col-md-6"**  
     </pre>  
     
   
</pre>

You should be used to this by now¬†:)  
`.bg-dark` gives the section a dark background. Contained within the section is a `container` and a nested `row.`

`align-items-center` is a Flexbox utility class that aligns the content of the `row` to the vertical center. Do not forget that every `row` is by default a `flex-container.`

`fill-80-viewport` is a tiny class I have written like so:

<pre name="963f" id="963f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.fill-80-viewport {  
  min-height: 80vh  
}</pre>

The class¬†`.fill-80-viewport` ensures that the section takes up `80%` of the user‚Äôs viewport height.

So, here‚Äôs the new stuff we haven‚Äôt discussed:

<pre name="7965" id="7965" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
   
     
       
     <pre class="col-12 **order-1 order-md-2"**  
     </pre>  
     
   
</pre>

Assuming you‚Äôre familiar with how Flexbox works, the `order` property determines the visual order in which `flex-items` are displayed. The item with the lowest `order` value is displayed first and the `highest` last. Essentially, the items are displayed in terms of increasing `order` values‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom lowest to highest.

The `order-` class names are an attempt to recreate this same behavior. They are Bootstrap Flexbox utility classes that allow for any integer values such as `order-5` and `order-10.`

An element with the class `order-2` has an higher order value than one with `order-1` You guessed right. The higher the integer value, the higher the `order` value.

The order class names also have responsive variations. Thus `order-md-1`will have an order value of 1 when viewed on medium sized device or larger. Consequently, `order-md-2` will have an `order` value of `2` when viewed on a medium sized device or larger.

In the light of these, you should be able to make sense of this:

<pre name="ff4c" id="ff4c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
<pre class="col-12 **order-1 order-md-2"**  
</pre></pre>

By default, the `pre` tag will be displayed first, then the `div`¬†. This is because `order-1` is displayed first, then `order-2` in terms of increasing `order` values. When viewed on larger devices, the content within the `div` will be displayed first, followed by the content within the `pre` tags.












When viewed on larger devices, the content within the `div` will be displayed first, followed by the content within the `pre`¬†tags.



The rest of the markup that makes up the section isn‚Äôt much to figure out. It is largely based on text and spacing utility classes we‚Äôve already spent so much time looking at.

Let‚Äôs move on the the next content section.

#### Building the testimonial section












The testimonial section as displayed on mobile and larger¬†devices.



If you‚Äôve been following along, it should be obvious that this one is very similar to the first content section.

It is made up of one column. The column seats on the right hand on larger devices, but stays aligned to the start on smaller devices. Here‚Äôs the markup that powers this section:

<pre name="a399" id="a399" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
        
        <h6 class="text-white-40">  
          what others think  
        </h6>  
        <h3>"Coding on Steroids is breath taking. I focus less on writing codes   
          while taking model shots around the world."</h3>  
        <p class="text-uppercase text-white-70">Founder, The Ocumpious Startup</p>  
        
    
    
</pre>

Pretty simple, huh?

`align-items-center` and `justify-content-end` do exactly as they read. The single column which represents the `flex-item` will be aligned to the vertical center and horizontal end.

By default, this column fills up the available space with`.col-12.` However, on medium devices and larger, it takes up just `50%` of the available width.

`basis-md-50` is a tiny class I have written like so:

<pre name="8e6e" id="8e6e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">[@media](http://twitter.com/media "Twitter profile for @media") screen and (min-width: 768px ){  
  .basis-md-50 {  
    flex-basis: 50%  
  }    
}</pre>

When the column takes up `100%` of the available width, it really can‚Äôt be forced to the end. You don‚Äôt get to see any visual feedback with respect to this. However, when the width of the column is reduced to `50%` it becomes evident.

That‚Äôs the trick to move the column to the right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon larger devices.

Let‚Äôs move on to the next section.

#### Building the featured¬†section












This section contains a list of icons, horizontally centered within the¬†section.



This one feels like child‚Äôs play. It‚Äôs really simple.

The markup consists of a list of font-awesome icons.

<pre name="6d10" id="6d10" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
        
          **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-free-code-camp my-3 mx-5"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
         ** <i** class="fa fa-3x fa-twitter my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
          **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-facebook my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
          **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-quora my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
          **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-reddit my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
          **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-pied-piper my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
        **  <i** class="fa fa-3x fa-paypal my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
        **<i** class="fa fa-3x fa-product-hunt my-3 mx-4"   
             aria-hidden="true"**></i>**  
        
      
    
</pre>

The class¬†`.text-center` ensures that these icons are always horizontally centered. This section utilizes a great deal of spacing classes. Do you see  
`my-3`, `mx-4` and `py-5` in the markup above?

Those are class names you‚Äôre already conversant with, right?

Yes!

Let‚Äôs move on to the next content section.

#### Building the product features¬†section












A section containing an header and a couple features aligned within multiple¬†columns.



The complete markup for this section can be seen below:

<pre name="4861" id="4861" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
        
        <h6 class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">  
          The bitter truth  
        </h6>  
        <h3 class="text-black-70">On a scale of 1 to 10, we make your life easier 10/10, period.</h3>

          <p>  
            Affordable as coffee.  
          </p>  
          
      
    
</pre>

While it may look complex, it is really simple when you closely examine it.

Like other sections, this one begins with giving the section an `id` and nesting a `container` within it.

<pre name="4a58" id="4a58" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
    ...  
    
</pre>

Unlike other sections, this one contains 2 nested rows.

<pre name="c213" id="c213" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
      
      
      
    
</pre>

The first row contains the section headline:












The headline highlighted.



The second row contains the list of image icons:












The icon list highlighted.



Below is the content of the first row:

<pre name="fe5a" id="fe5a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
        <h6 class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">  
          The bitter truth  
        </h6>  
        <h3 class="text-black-70">On a scale of 1 to 10, we make your life easier 10/10, period.</h3>  
</pre>

By default it takes up the available width of the row `col-12.`On medium devices. It takes up half the width `col-md-6` and it is horizontally centered `mx-auto.`

The other class names are stuff you‚Äôre already familiar with.

For clarity, `text-black-40` and `text-black-70` are tiny classes I have written like so:

<pre name="e81a" id="e81a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.text-black-70 {  
   color: rgba(0,0,0,0.7)   
}   
.text-black-40 {  
   color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)

By default, the columns fill the available space, take up a third of the available space in medium devices or larger, and the text and images are aligned to the center, `col-12 col-md-4 text-center.`

The `text-info` class on the `










This section contains a pricing¬†grid.



Pricing tables are very important‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you want your business to make money. Let‚Äôs have a look at how to build one.

The complete markup for this section is below:

<pre name="c457" id="c457" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">

          <li class="py-2">   
            API access</li>  
        </ul>  
        Start  
             

          
          <h6 class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">

          </ul>  
          Start  
            

          
          <h6 class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">

          </ul>  
          Start  
          
        
          
</pre>

Looks complex?

Don‚Äôt worry. Let me explain it.

The section begins with a nested container and two rows:

<pre name="0e8f" id="0e8f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
      
          
          
          
          
      
 </pre>

As always, the `section` has an `id`. The `bg-light` class gives the section a light background color.

The container has been set up to fill at least `80%` of the available viewport height. I have done this a couple times, it shouldn‚Äôt be strange:

<pre name="dcc4" id="dcc4" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">.fill-80-viewport {  
  min-height: 80vh  
}</pre>

Within the first row lies the section‚Äôs headline:

<pre name="7c19" id="7c19" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
     **<h6** class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">  
         pricing  
     </h6>  
     **<h3** class="text-black-70">we are very affordable</h3>  
</pre>

The headers are nested within a column that fills the available space on mobile devices while taking up half of the available width for medium devices or more `col-12 col-md-6.` The column is also styled to center its text content `text-center` and it sits in the center of the available width `mx-auto.`

The class names `text-black-40` and `text-black-70` are tiny classes I have written like so:

<pre name="db55" id="db55" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**.text-white-40** {  
  color: rgba(255,255,255,0.4)  
}  
**.text-white-70** {  
  color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)  
}</pre>

Within the second `row` lies the pricing tables.

Each pricing table is made up of this:

<pre name="f1f8" id="f1f8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
        <**h6** class="text-black-40 text-uppercase">  
            Personal  
          </h6>  
        <**img** src="[http://bit.ly/2y9EpP2](http://bit.ly/2y9EpP2)" class="my-4"/>  
        <p>Good enough power</p>  
        **<ul** class="list-unstyled list-border-black-20 list-border-y text-left text-black-70">       
          <li class="py-2"> monthly requests</li>  
          <li class="py-2">   
            technical support</li>  
          <li class="py-2">   
            API access</li>  
        **</ul>**  
        Start  
</pre>
















A breakdown of the components of the pricing¬†grid.







It‚Äôs basically an header, one image, an unordered list of features with a CTA button.

Duplicate this in three places and you have the 3-column pricing grid. You see how manageable the markup has become?

Most of the class names should be familiar with you. But look at this:

<pre name="2b45" id="2b45" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">...  
**<ul** class="**list-unstyled list-border-black-20 list-border-y** text-left text-black-70">   
   ...   
</ul></pre>

`list-unstyled` is a bootstrap class that removes the padding and list style that comes by default with unordered lists `ul`.

And these:

<pre name="c879" id="c879" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**list-border-black-20,  list-border-y**</pre>

`list-border-y` is a tiny class I have written to add borders only to the top and bottom of a list element.

<pre name="77ee" id="77ee" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**.list-border-y** li {  
  border-top: 1px solid  
}  
**.list-border-y** li:last-child {  
  border-bottom: 1px solid  
}</pre>

This is what gives the lists within the pricing table the `1px` borders.












The 1px borders around the list¬†items.



`list-border-black-20` is another tiny class that gives the borders a black transparent color.

These classes dont come with bootstrap, so we have to write ours.

<pre name="819f" id="819f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">**.list-border-black-20** li,  
**.list-border-black-20** li:last-child{  
  border-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2)  
}</pre>

Now, this makes the color of the borders appear as subtle transparent black.

That‚Äôs pretty much all there is to this content section. Let‚Äôs see the next.

#### Building the¬†footer












The footer¬†section.



This is the last content section for this page, and it represents the page‚Äôs footer.

The complete code for this section is shown below:

<pre name="da16" id="da16" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
          
          <ul class="list-unstyled">  
            <li><h6 class="text-white">ABOUT</h6></li>  
            <li>We‚Äôve been working on Coding on Steroids   
              for the all our lives.   
              A groundbreaking tech deserves such dedication, huh?

          </ul>  
          
          
          <ul class="list-unstyled">  
            <li><h6 class="text-white">PRODUCT</h6></li>  
            <li>Features</li>  
            <li>Examples</li>  
            <li>Tour</li>  
            <li>Gallery</li>  
          </ul>  
          
          
          <ul class="list-unstyled">  
            <li><h6 class="text-white">APIS</h6></li>  
            <li>Rich data</li>  
            <li>Simple</li>  
            <li>Real time</li>  
            <li>Social</li>  
          </ul>  
          
          
        <ul class="list-unstyled">  
          <li><h6 class="text-white">LEGAL</h6></li>  
          <li>Terms</li>  
          <li>Legal</li>  
          <li>Privacy</li>  
          <li>License</li>  
        </ul>  
           
      
     
</pre>

Now, let‚Äôs analyze it.

Everything is simple when broken down into smaller bits.

The `section` begins with a nested `container` and row.

<pre name="230e" id="230e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">  
    
      
      
    
</pre>

As always, I gave the section an `id`¬†. The `bg-dark` class will give the footer a dark background.

Within this column there are four columns.
















The four columns that make up the¬†footer.







<pre name="cca8" id="cca8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--figure">  
  
  
  
  
  
  
</pre>

Each column will take up the available space when viewed on mobile devices `col-12`

The first column takes up half the available width on medium and larger devices `col-md-6,` while the other columns take up a third of the remaining halved space available `col-md-2.` The grid sums up to 12 eventually. `6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12`

Within the first column is an unordered list and a bunch of list items. `list-unstyled` ensures the default spacing and list style is removed from the `ul.`

<pre name="f162" id="f162" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><ul class="**list-unstyled**">  
   <li><h6 class="**text-white**">ABOUT</h6></li>  
   <li>We‚Äôve been working on Coding on Steroids   
       for the all our lives.   
       A groundbreaking tech deserves such dedication, huh?    
       If you‚Äôd like to learn more, or are interested in a job,   
       contact us anytime at   
       [@ohansemmanuel](http://twitter.com/ohansemmanuel "Twitter profile for @ohansemmanuel")</li>  
</ul></pre>

The other columns contain an unordered list with a bunch of list items too:

<pre name="f625" id="f625" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><ul class="**list-unstyled**">  
    <li><h6 class="**text-white**">PRODUCT</h6></li>  
    <li>Features</li>  
    <li>Examples</li>  
    <li>Tour</li>  
    <li>Gallery</li>  
 </ul></pre>

And that‚Äôs all of it!

Pretty cool, huh?

Thanks a lot for following along!

### Conclusion and More Information

A few months back when I started writing this article, I planned on writing everything I knew about Bootstrap. However, that turned out to be a lot üòÇ.

The medium article would have been so long, I was worried no one would bother to read it üòû.

The topics I have skipped include:

1.  Introduction to Sass/SCSS
2.  How to Customize Bootstrap using Sass
3.  How to use the Bootstrap CLI tool for quicker set up
4.  How to Create your own Build Process using Gulp and Webpack
5.  How to build Professional Bootstrap themes eg. Admin dashboard themes
6.  How to use Bootstrap 4 with ReactJS
7.  More Practical Examples, such as How to Build a Twitter and Medium clone with Bootstrap. These examples utilize JavaScript and more Bootstrap components

There‚Äôs good news!

I‚Äôm writing these, but I have distilled them into a comprehensive book. You may want to stay in touch, and [get notified](http://eepurl.com/c8eokf) about the book release.

If you look to become a senior developer, you shouldn‚Äôt shy away from having a wide range of experience with various technologies.

Cheers,

_Ohans Emmanuel_

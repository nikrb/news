# Best Gitter channels: PHP

PHP (recursive acronym for _PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor_) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. Created by [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf "Rasmus Lerdorf") in 1994, PHP originally stood for _Personal Home Page._

The strengths of PHP are its pragmatic APIs, good documentation, and easy deployment. However, many developers ask themselves [whether PHP is still worth learning today](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-learn-PHP-today-Is-it-still-worth-it) due to the inconsistencies in its design.

According to [W3Tech Web Technology Surveys](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all), PHP is used by 82.2% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know, and learning it could surely help you to know more about programming in general.

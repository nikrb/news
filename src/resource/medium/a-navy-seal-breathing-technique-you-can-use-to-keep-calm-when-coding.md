# A Navy Seal breathing technique you can use to keep calm when coding

The US Navy Seals teach a technique for calming yourself down called “Combat Tactical Breathing.”

The next time you feel frustrated or anxious after encountering a failing test or cryptic error message, try this. I guarantee it will work better than pounding your head on your desk.

1.  inhale for 4 seconds (as the circle expands)
2.  hold your lungs full of air for 4 seconds (as the circle stays fully expanded)
3.  then exhale for 4 seconds (as the circle shrinks)
4.  hold your lungs empty for 4 seconds (as the circle is contracted)

You can repeat this process ([as detailed here](https://fcc.im/2pZNG5E)) as many times as you need until you feel calm. Then get back to coding!

### Here are three links worth your time:

2.  How to push past the trolls and get the help you need on Stack Overflow ([4 minute read](https://fcc.im/2qKNFFw))
3.  Understanding Node.js Event-Driven Architecture ([12 minute read](https://fcc.im/2pXotdU))

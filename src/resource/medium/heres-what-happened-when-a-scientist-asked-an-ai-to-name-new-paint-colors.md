# Here’s what happened when a scientist asked an AI to name new paint colors

A scientist fed a database of 7,700 paint colors into a neural network. Then, based on her training data, she asked the computer to create a few paint colors of its own.

At first, it the AI created gibberish names:

And names that didn’t correspond at all to the color:

But after a few tweaks to her algorithms, and some time spent training the neural network, the AI started cranking out charming color names like these:

Here are three links worth your time:

1.  A designer drew 8 iconic X-Men using nothing but CSS ([1 minute interactive](http://bit.ly/2npANQr))
2.  Raspberry Pi just turned 5\. Here’s a brief history of the world’s tiniest hobbyist computer. ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2nkmYpE))
3.  A chatbot that overturned 160,000 parking fines is now helping refugees claim asylum ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2npzz7X))

### Thought of the day:

### Funny of the day:

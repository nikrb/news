Here are three links worth your time:

1.  Why American farmers are hacking their tractors with Ukrainian firmware ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2nnz4xJ))
2.  How I got a second degree and earned 5 developer certifications in just one year, while working and raising two kids ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mUB5hO))
3.  How my side project satisfied my curiosity — and made me $3,000 ([4 minute read](http://bit.ly/2o5cpTL))

Bonus: I live-interviewed Colm Tuite, a self-taught designer and developer from Ireland whose startup was recently acquired ([32 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2nSgjjI))

# Short, Interactive, Browser-based

During our first two months, we learned a lot about our community by talking with them and observing their behavior. Based on these insights, we’ve completely overhauled our challenges to be:

*   Short — You can finish each challenge in a single sitting.
*   Browser-based — You’ll start coding immediately, without installing anything.
*   Fully interactive — You’ll code 100% of the time.

_Our new modular challenges mean you can build your skills brick-by-brick over time._

These challenges represent your first 100 hours of coding. They help you establish a baseline understanding of coding tools and best practices. Along the way, you’ll have the support of a community of busy people who have made learning to code a priority.

Then the real learning begins. You’ll set up your development environment, form a team, and start [building projects for nonprofits](https://trello.com/b/BA3xVpz9/nonprofit-projects).

_The first 100 hours of coding challenges give you a baseline to prepare you for the 900 hours of project-oriented learning to follow._

We look forward to hearing your insights, answering your questions, and pair programming with you!

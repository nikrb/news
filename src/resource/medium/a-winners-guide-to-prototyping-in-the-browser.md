# I wrote a playbook to help designers build prototypes using real code

I’ve built a [Prototyping Playbook](https://mattrothenberg.github.io/prototyping-playbook/) — a blog of short tutorials (or “plays”) that help designers use the browser for their design and prototyping needs.

Over time, I hope to build a comprehensive set of articles about how to implement specific designs. Designers — particularly ones new to front-end development — can leverage these patterns if they are stuck implementing a design decision.

For instance:

*   I can’t figure out how to populate this table with data
*   I can’t figure out how to show a spinner after this button is pressed
*   I can’t figure out how to turn this piece of markup into a “symbol” that can be used & repeated elsewhere

### The Goals

People learn best by doing. So the goal of each tutorial is to shed light on a fundamental concept of front-end development.

For example, when designers populate a table with data, they see **iteration** in action. When designers see a spinner after a button is pressed, they get a glimpse of **asynchronous events**. When designers turn a custom piece of markup into something reusable, they are learn **componentization** through practicing it.

The more practical goal is to be a friendly, comprehensive resource for designers to experiment with prototyping in the browser.

I’m fully aware of the myriad resources available to designers to sharpen their front-end skills. For example, websites like [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) have a ton of great articles on these topics.

This said, I haven’t found an exhaustive collection of short, digestible, and _practical_ tutorials on these topics. And this is precisely what the Prototyping Playbook will provide.

### The Content Model

For each “play” in the playbook, I’ve created the following content model:

1.  A **title** describing the concept(s) to be covered
2.  A **scenario** for applying a specific front-end prototyping tool
3.  A **low-fidelity mockup** of the intended design decision
4.  A guided **implementation** of the design decision in Vanilla JavaScript (ES6), Vue JS, and React JS

### The First Issue

The first issue covers the three aforementioned scenarios.

You can view this issue of the Prototyping Playbook [here](https://mattrothenberg.github.io/prototyping-playbook/).

This is still a work in progress. Some of the lingering questions I have are:

*   How can we improve the content model?
*   Are these scenarios realistic, understandable, and applicable?
*   Did we implement any design decisions in unconventional ways?

I welcome your feedback via a [GitHub issue or pull request](https://github.com/mattrothenberg/prototyping-playbook/).

In addition to feedback, I’m curious to see _how_ you apply these techniques. Feel free to share a prototype that you’re currently working on, particularly if you’ve implemented and improved upon a technique that you found in the playbook. Sharing is caring.

Moreover, I’m open to suggestions for future issues of the playbook. Other topics may include:

*   Working with fake/dummy data
*   Empty and Error States

Happy Hacking!

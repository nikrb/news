# Why does it cost $1,000 to list a job on Free Code Camp?

I’ve recently spoken with employers looking for JavaScript developers.

Their complaints vary:

“It doesn’t make sense for us to hire a recruitment firm just to fill a non-senior developer role.”

“It takes too much time to sift through hundreds of applicants from job boards.”

“We really need someone with experience.”

[Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com) is uniquely positioned to address all of these problems.

#### _Software engineers with experience are hard to find._

Employers want to hire someone with work experience — someone who can hit the ground running on day one. And they don’t want to spend a small fortune in the process.

At [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com), we code for a cause. That means that our software engineers already have experience coding for real nonprofit organizations by the time they finish our program. That also means our developers have agile development experience and are seasoned pair programmers.

#### _It’s a great value for employers, time-wise and money-wise._

Many startups and small businesses don’t have the human resources department they need for an in-house recruiting operation. This leaves the hiring process up to other engineers, and in some cases even the CTO.

It’s unlikely these key employees have the time to sift through hundreds of applicants. Let’s face it — they could be doing something more immediately useful, like coding.

When you post a job on Free Code Camp, only developers who’ve completed our rigorous certifications are able to apply to your job listing.

From an employer’s perspective, this means fewer, but higher-quality applicants for substantially less money than it costs to hire a recruitment firm.

#### Free Code Camp is a meritocracy engine. And it works.

Free Code Camp is an open source community of over 150,000 developers. It is self-paced and free for everyone. We are not a selective program.

Instead of filtering people out like other programs, we admit everyone. Then only the most motivated developers persevere through our rigorous series of challenges to earn our certifications.

These challenges involve building dozens of projects—data visualizations, APIs, dynamic web applications — from nothing more than a list of agile user stories. They also require several hundred hours of practice with data structures and algorithms.

Finishing our entire program is a [full year of coding experience](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learn-to-code-by-coding-d1e241de81c0).

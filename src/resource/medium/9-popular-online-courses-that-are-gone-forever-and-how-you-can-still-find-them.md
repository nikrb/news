# 9 popular online courses that are gone forever… and how you can still find them







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2DVs3FFw-RbvNVkA.png)







Since free online courses first took off back in late 2011, more than [7,000 online courses](https://www.class-central.com/) have been created by over [700 universities](https://www.class-central.com/universities) worldwide.

But almost a third of these courses are listed as “[finished](https://www.class-central.com/courses/past)” on [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/). This means that we don’t know when (or if) these courses will ever be offered again.

Last year, we lost a few hundred of these courses when Coursera [shut down their old technology platform](https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-old-platform-shutdown-download-courses/).

Some of these courses have come back, or even migrated to a different course platform. But many of the courses have been offline for years and, in many cases, course platforms have removed the description pages for the courses from their websites. It’s like they never existed. A few of these courses have hundreds of reviews on Class Central and were taken by hundreds of thousands of learners.

Luckily, Class Central has an almost complete history of all the courses that have ever been offered. I combed through all the finished courses and made a list of a few popular courses. Where possible, I will recommend an alternative source to get access to the course videos.

### 1\. A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior with Dan Ariely





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/4137a082fcc738f05013ca504f770e00?postId=a716ddf8e1d9" data-media-id="4137a082fcc738f05013ca504f770e00" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FywanX0GL-1U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





If you like to read articles or listen to podcasts about economics, you might know who [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/) is. He is a Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, and is often used as the subject matter “expert” in media. He is quite a popular figure — his TED talk has been watched by over seven million people, and he has written multiple New York Times bestsellers.

Back in March 2013, Dan Ariely also launched a hugely popular course on Coursera entitled _A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior._ The course page no longer exists on Coursera, but you can find it on [Class Central here](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/424/coursera-a-beginner-s-guide-to-irrational-behavior). It was last offered in March 2014 and has over 500 reviews on Class Central — and almost all of them are 5 star reviews. In fact it is still the highest rated course in psychology on Class Central.

You can read on Quora [why the course was taken down](https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Dan-Ariely-course-been-removed-from-Coursera).

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

Another Quora user has [backed up the course materials](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-the-videos-by-professor-Dan-Ariely-for-A-Beginners-Guide-to-Irrational-Behavior). You can find [week 1 — week 5 here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9AAtHvw6OPiX0pELUU2SEc5SlE) and [week 6](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aj7ruq7ypmnttd2/AADsSyfye21BKT4GKzWf8ZAVa?dl=0) here. If you search on YouTube you will also find a number of talks given by Dan Ariely. These are not videos from the course, but there might be some overlap.

### 2\. CS188.1x: Artificial Intelligence





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/7cd5d94b5ed15fbd136aadaf9b519512?postId=a716ddf8e1d9" data-media-id="7cd5d94b5ed15fbd136aadaf9b519512" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZevD-DY2eQE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





It was disappointing to see this edX course taken down. UC Berkeley’s [CS188.1X](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/445/edx-cs188-1x-artificial-intelligence) is one of Class Central’s [Top 50 online courses of all time](https://www.class-central.com/collection/top-free-online-courses), as well as the #2 highest rated course on our [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.class-central.com/subject/ai?sort=rating-up) subject page. We even published a [1,100 word in-depth review](https://www.class-central.com/report/review-edx-uc-berkeley-artificial-intelligence/) for this course. Here is what the reviewer ([Mal Minhas](http://malm.teqy.net/)) had to say:

> _“It is not simply the best course on AI ever made available online. It is the best course ever made available on any subject.”_

According to Mal, CS188.1x was an extremely demanding and difficult course, but it was also rewarding. Here is a GIF of one of Mal’s project submissions.

You should seriously consider reading Mal’s [entire review](https://www.class-central.com/report/review-edx-uc-berkeley-artificial-intelligence/) to learn about this amazing course that you will never get to experience.

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

Just kidding. The professors of the course have made all the course materials available [on their website](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html).

### 3\. Social Psychology





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/0a3e9157560150a0352f3e8f0284598b?postId=a716ddf8e1d9" data-media-id="0a3e9157560150a0352f3e8f0284598b" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8SyZPBywvNs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





This is another highly popular psychology course. In fact, it’s the [#3 rated psychology course](https://www.class-central.com/subject/psychology?sort=rating-up) on Class Central. Launched in August 2013, [Social Psychology](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/555/coursera-social-psychology) has been taken by more than half a million learners worldwide. The course once boasted the single largest course session in the world, with 250k learners enrolled. Even in the heyday of free online courses, this number was pretty impressive.

The instructor of the course, Scott Pious, is Professor of Psychology at the Department of Psychology, Wesleyan University. He is also the founder of the Social Psychology Network (SPN), the world’s largest online community dedicated to social psychology.

The course went down when Coursera shut down their [old platform last year.](https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-old-platform-shutdown-download-courses/)

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

An earlier version of the article pointed to a different course uploaded to Academic Torrents. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find an alternative source for Social Psychology.

**Update**: [Mohammad Yasser](https://medium.com/@Miro99) has uploaded Social Psychology videos to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B39jsuKsL3G8UzFIOEZzYWVMY1E). Thanks [Mohammad Yasser](https://medium.com/@Miro99).

### 4\. A Brief History of Humankind





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/f11f8668b1c2aadf20f97e07861e7c88?postId=a716ddf8e1d9" data-media-id="f11f8668b1c2aadf20f97e07861e7c88" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FsGdMBqDPB1A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





Dr. Yuval Noah Harari is an Israeli historian and a tenured professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Like Dan Ariely, you might come across him in mainstream publications.



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*91sO0wEBsjiI-E7b.jpg)

_A quick search on Google News shows a number of mentions for Dr. Yuval Noah Harari._



He is the author of a number of books, including the highly rated [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Yuval-Noah-Harari/e/B00J21BCIW/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1). According to Amazon Author Beta, which ranks authors, Dr. Yuval is the #3 author for history. Wouldn’t it be amazing to be able to take a course directly from such a popular and mainstream figure?

The last time you could do that was in August 2014, when the course was offered on Coursera. His course, [A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/566/coursera-a-brief-history-of-humankind), is another highly-rated course on Class Central that we might never see again. You can check out the syllabus by visiting the [course page](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/566/coursera-a-brief-history-of-humankind) on Class Central. Lecture 17 is entitled “Lecture 17: The End of Homo Sapiens.”

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

You don’t have to break the law to get access to the course materials for this one. Dr, Yuval has uploaded the course on YouTube. [here is the link to the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfc2WtGuVPdmhYaQjd449k-YeY71fiaFp).

### 5\. 6\. 7\. Natural Language Processing (3 courses)

This course might as well be called _Defence Against the Dark Arts_. For some reason, there have been three iterations of the Natural Language Processing course on Coursera, and none of them are available right now. Here is the list of these three courses.

1.  [Natural Language Processing](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/836/coursera-natural-language-processing): Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, Stanford University. First taught in March 2012, it was one of the first 20 courses offered on Coursera (now there are more than 2,000).
2.  [Natural Language Processing](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/836/coursera-natural-language-processing): Michael Collins, Columbia University. Offered in February 2013.
3.  [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/3332/coursera-introduction-to-natural-language-processing): Dragomir Radev, University of Michigan. This course is a relatively new one and has been offered a few times since it first launched on Coursera in October 2015\. The Coursera course page for this course still exists, but it does not have an upcoming course date. I am hopeful that this one will come back online eventually.

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

Each of these courses can be found in two places: YouTube and Academic Torrents. The advantage of Academic Torrents is that you can also download the supplementary course materials, like transcripts, PDFs, or PPTs.

1.  Natural Language Processing: Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, Stanford University. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68&list=PL6397E4B26D00A269) | [Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/details/d2c8f8f1651740520b7dfab23438d89bc8c0c0ab)
2.  Natural Language Processing: Michael Collins, Columbia University. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mieV29RVpuQ&list=PLGQnlmH5d2z6ehl1bTY8BQxDTCHfr1TSY) | [Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/details/8a8f93e18dd6c46c48ee2936ed500b1ff4cc9175)
3.  Introduction to Natural Language Processing: Dragomir Radev, University of Michigan. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25JjoixM3I&list=PLLssT5z_DsK8BdawOVCCaTCO99Ya58ryR) | [Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/details/78515f90de063ffc144be5e7e726c03849b4e0ed)

### 8\. A History of the World since 1300 / Global History Lab





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/3b061d2b9866ddc743be3356ac91f89b?postId=a716ddf8e1d9" data-media-id="3b061d2b9866ddc743be3356ac91f89b" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FcxiLTIXajeQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





This Princeton University course has an interesting history (hah!). It been offered on three different platforms. First it was [offered on Coursera](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/351/coursera-a-history-of-the-world-since-1300) in September 2012 under the name _A History of the World since 1300_. In September 2014 it moved to NovoEd, and it was called _Global History Lab_. Finally, it [showed up on edX](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/2371/edx-global-history-lab) in September 2016\. Maybe Professor Adelman likes to offer this course every two years. The materials might have changed partially or completely between these iterations of the course.

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

Unfortunately, I could not find the course materials. If you can find it, leave a comment below. If you still have access to the [edX iteration](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/2371/edx-global-history-lab) of the course, maybe you can create a playlist of the videos. EdX hosts all their videos on YouTube in unlisted mode. You can’t search for them, but if you have access to them then you can create a playlist and let us know in the comments below :)

### 9\. Startup Engineering

Startup Engineering is a Stanford course that “Bridges the gap between academic computer science and production software engineering.”

It was offered once on Coursera, back in [June 2013](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/626/coursera-startup-engineering). The course is taught by Balaji S. Srinivasan; he was CTO and co-founder of Counsyl, a genomics startup that began in a Stanford dorm room and now tests ~4% of all U.S. births. Early this year he was also considered by the Trump administration to lead the FDA (yes, Balaji hates the FDA). Currently, he is a board member at VC firm A16Z and a CEO/co-founder at 21.co.

The course had another instructor, Dr. Vijay Pande, a professor at Stanford, but it looks like all the videos in the course feature Balaji.

#### **Where to find the course materials?**

You can find all the videos of the course in [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3APsyUvAZI&list=PL58C6Q25sEEFVyISrZc80RhYFpyMF_DYl).

I’m sure I missed a lot of courses. Do let me know in the comments if your favorite course has disappeared from the online course platforms.

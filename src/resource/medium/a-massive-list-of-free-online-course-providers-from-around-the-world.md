# A Massive List of Free Online University Course Providers From Around The World







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*n1bm7OmooHG1QtUr181tAg.png)







It’s been more than five years since online education got a massive boost when three free online courses, taught by Stanford professors, launched in October 2011\. Each of these courses has had over 100,000 students.

Professors launched three online course websites: Coursera, edX, and Udacity. And the media started calling the courses provided by these websites “MOOCs”: **Massive Open Online Courses**.

Since then, more than [700 universities](https://www.class-central.com/universities) around the world have launched free online courses.

By the end of 2016, around [58 million students](https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-stats-and-trends-2016/) had signed up for at least one MOOC.

Many countries around the world — like India, Mexico, Thailand, and Italy — have launched their own country-specific MOOC platforms.

At [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) we try to catalog as many MOOCs as possible. So far, we’ve cataloged over 7,000 of them. But due to limited resources (and sometimes language barriers), we cannot index every one of them.

I’ve made this list of 33 MOOC providers from all over the world. This list has been adapted with permission from [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.amazon.com/Mindshift-Obstacles-Learning-Discover-Potential/dp/1101982853/), by Barbara Oakley, Tarcher-Perigee, April 2017\. And I’ve also expanded upon the list, and included a few extra regional MOOC providers.

Our focus has mostly been on course providers that partner with universities and offer free online courses. So if you know of any MOOC providers that we missed, let me know in the comments below.

### 1\. Coursera (United States)



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ccVlKVoYRK2cR_0J.jpg)



Coursera officially launched in January 2012, and it was started by two Stanford professors — Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller.

With over 25 million students and $146.1 million raised in funding, Coursera is the biggest MOOC/online education provider in the world. It has over 150 university partners from 29 countries and 2,000+ online courses.

Beyond single courses, Coursera offers its own credential, which is know as a Specialization, and it also offers fully-online Masters degrees. Coursera is also expanding into B2B via its Coursera for Business product.

Back in October 2016, the platform had over 400 courses. It’s built upon a heavily customized version of Open edX. XuetangX also has a cloud LMS product that is used by universities across China, and which is currently used by 1.5 million Chinese students.

Udacity is a tech unicorn, and it partners with technology companies to create Nanodegrees that train students for a particular job. In recent times, it has launched an AI Nanodegree with IBM Watson and a Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The co-creators of the latter include car companies like Mercedes Benz, BMW, and McLaren. These Nanodegrees cost, and they can take a few months to complete. Courses that are part of the Nanodegree are available for free, and Udacity currently has close to 200 free online courses.

Udacity has also partnered with Georgia Tech to create and launch a low cost, completely online Masters in Computer Science degree. At this moment there are more than 4,000 students enrolled in the Master’s program. Udacity was founded by Stanford professor Sebastian Thrun, the man behind Google’s self-driving car project. He is currently the president of Udacity and the CEO of a flying car company called Kitty Hawk.

Kadenze is a MOOC platform that specializes in the field of creative and arts education. It partners with some of the best art institutions and universities around the world to launch online courses.

It was co-founded by Ajay Kapur, a classically trained Indian musician and computer scientist. He is Associate Dean for Research and Development in Digital Arts at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). In October 2013 he taught a course called “Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists” on Coursera. However, he soon realized that some of the things he wanted to do with arts education were not possible with Coursera, so he created his own platform.

Kadenze has also launched its own certificate initiative, which is called Kadenze Programs. The first course in the program is free, but the rest are not. Students can also earn academic credit for many Kadenze courses/programs.

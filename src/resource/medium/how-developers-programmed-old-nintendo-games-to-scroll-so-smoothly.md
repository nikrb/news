2.  LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2ndHeWH))
3.  Beau’s screencast introduction to Clean Code ([6 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2mtxauh))

Bonus: We’re building a massive public dataset on people who started programming in the past 5 years ([2 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mKKGuv))

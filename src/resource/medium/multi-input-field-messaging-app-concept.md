# A multi-input field messaging appÂ concept

Some time ago [I shared in a Medium article](https://medium.com/@dawdus/freeing-the-bubbles-context-aware-messaging-app-8466abdcda27) the idea for context aware messenger app. The idea challenged the design limitation behind all messenger apps allowing you to write only one message at a time.

What I always missed in these apps was a way to save the message Iâ€™m currently typing and type and send something else instead. Then a way to get back to previously composed message and continue. Just to stay on topic and keep some order in my conversations.

Left to right: Messages, Slack, Hangouts, Messenger, Whatsapp.







The way I do it today involves the sequence of text field related gestures: **Long press, Select All, Cut, Type in, Send, Long press, Paste, continue.**

My concept allowed to replace that sequence with a single tap, but it was up to the app to recognise the need for saving a message based on the context of the conversation. I built a Quartz Composer prototype to show the feature in action:

**But I never shared the prototype**, as it wasnâ€™t functional, allowed for only one extra input field and was done solely for the purpose of recording that video. Also Origami prototypes for Quartz Composer didnâ€™t work very well on the device (not mentioning the absence of native keyboard).

**Release of** [**Origami Studio**](http://origami.design) **allowed me to revisit the concept and build fully functional (sort of) prototype to share.**

I ditched the context aware part and allowed for saving as many drafts as you need, whenever you feel like it.

### **Hereâ€™s a demo video of the new prototype.**

Using the multi input messenger in context of a conversation.







### Building in OrigamiÂ Studio.

I could write a separate article/tutorial for each of the technical challenges I encountered while building the proto, but Iâ€™ll limit myself to just briefly list some of them here. Hopefully these short descriptions will be enough to spark some ideas whenever you encounter similar blocks. If not donâ€™t hesitate to [ping me directly](https://twitter.com/dawidwoldu).

### **Multi line inputÂ field.**

Text Field component in Origami Studio doesnâ€™t allow for multi line inputs. When you double tap on it to reveal itâ€™s contentâ€™s youâ€™ll find the actual Text Input component that does. The problem is it doesnâ€™t have a cursor/caret. So hacked in a cursor by measuring the position of the last letter in the text field.

Each time you type a letter I check if itâ€™s a â€˜spaceâ€™ and if it is I append itâ€™s index to an Array of spaces. Then I assume that whenever height of the input increases the text will break at the last recorded space. Then I measure the rest of the text to place a cursor in a correct position of the new line. When you donâ€™t tap the space I just measure the size of the text that fit the line.

### **Building a conversation feed.**

The challenge here was dynamically creating chat bubbles while keeping the correct order in the feed. When bot starts typing you can see the last bubble on the feed with 3 jumping dots. But if you send the message before it finishes typing your bubble should land on the feed before the botâ€™s bubble. I managed to make it work by keeping two arrays of messages. Temporary one (bot typing) and final and switching between them whenever bot starts typing or sends the message.

I created a JSON config file with the bot messages that allow you to configure what and when the bot is sending and if it should wait for your message(s) to start typing.

<pre name="eb5f" id="eb5f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">{"message":"Ok, I'm dumb. What do you want from me?!", "waitforuser":2,"delay":1}</pre>

**waitforuserâ€Š**â€”â€Šdescribes how many user messages should the bot wait for before it starts typing. Zero means it wonâ€™t wait for user at all.  
**delayâ€Š**â€”â€Štime in seconds before bot starts typing.

### **Creating/removing input fields and managing theirÂ order.**

Whenever you create input field Iâ€™m increasing the count on the Loop patch, but as soon as you donâ€™t need the field anymore I tried to remove the field from the loop and keep the other input fields keep their order and content. It was impossible for me to figure out as **loop patches donâ€™t keep the reference to the actual instance of the element theyâ€™re replicating**. I worked around by hiding and reusing unused fields instead of removing them from the loop.

### Downloads!

You can download Origami prototype, JSON file as well as multiline text field component from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9oWvt9KHdw0T2hOcUdlUFMtMVk?usp=sharing).

#### **Userâ€™s Manual:**

**Long press on Send button** to save the current text and create new input field. (Yes! Itâ€™s undiscoverable. I know.)  
Prototype is optimised for use on the device. (You canâ€™t hide the keyboard)

### **Last minute discovered funÂ facts:**

* The prototype crashes when using emojis. ðŸ‘Œ  
* Multi line input field cursor can behave erratically when typing super fast (Iâ€™m sharing anyway).  
* When you send a message in the exact time that bot starts typing, the empty bot message can appear on the feed.  
* Other bug fixes and performance improvements. (What?!)

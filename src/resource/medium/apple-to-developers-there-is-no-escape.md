# Apple to developers: There is no¬†escape.

For developers who were thinking about getting a new work laptop, here‚Äôs what Apple announced today:

*   They‚Äôre killing off the MacBook Air, one of the best-designed, most beloved laptops ever (which I‚Äôm using to type this)
*   Their new laptops have the same amount of RAM‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand similar processors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto what they had years ago
*   They‚Äôre replacing the escape key and function keys‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwidely used by developers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith a little emoji bar

Of course, it will be used for a lot of other things, too:

At least they‚Äôre not removing the headphone jack yet.

But they did get rid of pretty much every other type of port.

How many Macs did Apple sell in the past 4 quarters? 19 million.

How many developers are there on earth? 19 million.

Funny coincidence, eh?





<iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/515defdf06e27c33dc48663959212a68?postId=298b63c2a1d8" data-media-id="515defdf06e27c33dc48663959212a68" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F459455847165218816%2FI_sH-zvU_bigger.jpeg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





Apple is clearly resting on their laurels. They aren‚Äôt listening to at least one of their major customer segments: developers.

### Same specs, different day

MacBook Pros have offered up to 16 gigabytes of RAM since 2010\. Guess where the 2016 MacBook Pro maxes out? 16 gigabytes. And that‚Äôs after a paid upgrade.





<iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/83a7faea7c5946cfc89640f771a44ee7?postId=298b63c2a1d8" data-media-id="83a7faea7c5946cfc89640f771a44ee7" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F757910701805625344%2FE0uV5Ndl_bigger.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





MacBook Pros offered dual-core 2.4 gigahertz processors in 201o. Guess what the stock 2016 MacBook Pro 13" comes with? Dual-core 2.0 gigahertz processors.

Thanks to [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott) for pointing out that you can upgrade the 15" version that up to a quad-core 2.9 gigahertz‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut this version costs $3,000.

When you buy a brand new 2016 MacBook Pro, you‚Äôre paying $2,000 for what amounts to 2010 hardware with some marginal improvements on top of it. While there has [been some progress](https://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks) over the past 6 years, the prices have remained significantly higher than what you would pay for comparable non-Apple hardware.





<iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/25c7e4604519d6319a62f46f9ba1fddf?postId=298b63c2a1d8" data-media-id="25c7e4604519d6319a62f46f9ba1fddf" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F747869815457579008%2FdJ7gSwDt_bigger.jpg&amp;key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





You can buy laptops with comparable specs (without nice-to-haves like the Retina display and the fancy Force Touch trackpad) for half the price. For example, here are a couple highly-rated laptops:

[**Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E460 14" HD Screen (1366x768), Intel Dual Core i5-6200U 2.2 GHz, 16GB RAM‚Ä¶**  
_Edit description_amzn.to](http://amzn.to/2fbMwC2 "http://amzn.to/2fbMwC2")[](http://amzn.to/2fbMwC2)

[**HP Pavilion 17 Gaming Laptop (Intel i7-6700HQ, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 128GB SSD + 1TB 7200rpm HDD, NVIDIA‚Ä¶**  
_Edit description_amzn.to](http://amzn.to/2eWy0ZT "http://amzn.to/2eWy0ZT")[](http://amzn.to/2eWy0ZT)

Let‚Äôs face it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen a developer buys a Mac, what they‚Äôre really paying for is the software. The operating system. And the ecosystem of development tools built around that operating system.

Fortunately, there‚Äôs another Unix-like operating system that you can install on your computer: Linux.

Linux is nowhere near as user-friendly as MacOS. But with more resources from laptop manufacturers, it could get there, and quickly.

Even Linux arch-nemesis Microsoft has recently made strides to become more developer-friendly. Windows 10 now comes with [partial Linux support](http://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/).

### A second sunrise for desktop¬†Linux?

MacBooks are becoming a less-appealing option for developers. But this is probably a big win for everyone in the long term.

With better competition from Windows, and more resources poured into Linux distributions, developers may soon have a wide range of great operating systems that can run on cheap ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù hardware.

# 25 Android libraries you definitely want to try out in early¬†2017











![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3oNgt5C2JC5FucjUm2SPxg.jpeg)












This is a list of 25 best Android libraries **released in January and February 2017\.** All of these are worth trying out‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are not in ranked order.Let‚Äôs get started!

1.  [**Lottie**](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)  
    This is a library that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as JSON with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) (After Effects plugin for exporting animations to SVG/Canvas/HTML + JavaScript) and renders them natively on mobile.¬†  
    There is also an example app available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.lottie).  
    The more than 7,500 Github users who starred this library can not be wrong!

2\. [**Toasty**](https://github.com/GrenderG/Toasty)This is a library for creating customized `Toasts`. As the author described the lib, it is:

> _‚ÄúThe usual Toast, but with steroids.‚Äù_

You can find screenshots and the link to the library below.














[**GrenderG/Toasty**

3\. [**StyleableToast**](https://github.com/Muddz/StyleableToast)This is another library for `Toasts` customization. It adds:

> _‚Äúvariety of styling options that gives your app and user experience that little extra unique feeling! Style your toast either by code or in styles.xml!‚Äù_

4\. [**Store**](https://github.com/NYTimes/Store)Store is a library for Async Data Loading and Caching. According to the documentation:

> _‚ÄúStore is a class that simplifies fetching, parsing, storage, and retrieval of data in your application. A Store is similar to the_ [_Repository pattern_](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx) _while exposing a Reactive API built with RxJava that adheres to a unidirectional data flow.‚Äù_

The documentation is really comprehensive and the lib is for sure worth trying. You can check many flows such as data requests, caching and parsing.

5\. [**PreviewSeekBar**](https://github.com/rubensousa/PreviewSeekBar)If you use Google Play Movies, you have probably noticed this great animated `SeekBar` with a preview of the movie. It turned out that [R√∫ben Sousa](https://medium.com/@rubensousa) implemented that as an open-source library. The gif below gives a good flavor of its functionalities. If your app is for instance a movie player, you should definitely try it!

18\. [**Bridge**](https://github.com/afollestad/bridge)

> _‚ÄúBridge is a simple but powerful HTTP networking library for Android. It features a Fluent chainable API, powered by Java/Android‚Äôs_ `_URLConnection_` _classes for maximum compatibility and speed.‚Äù_

This library has a really comprehensive documentation and is definitely worth checking out.

19\. [**Ason**](https://github.com/afollestad/ason)  
It is the second library from [Aidan Follestad](https://twitter.com/afollestad). Its main idea is to simplify an interaction with JSON. The library:

> _‚Äúalso makes (de)serialization painless.‚Äù_

The documentation is also pretty good. You can check it out here:

20\. [**ObjectBox**](https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox)I assume that majority of you knows [greenrobot](http://greenrobot.org/). If not, they developed [GreenDAO](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) and [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus). Now, this is time for a new database for objects focused on performance. As greenrobot claims,

> _‚Äú_**_Performance_** _is the number one reason why we created ObjectBox. Previously, we created greenDAO, the fastest Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) for Android and SQLite. Since its first release in 2011, we gained a lot of insight into object persistence‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the performance limitations imposed by SQLite. We realized that in order to improve performance on mobile significantly, we needed to go to the core and build a database designed for objects.‚Äù_














You can read more about it [here](http://greenrobot.org/announcement/introducing-objectbox-beta/). Please take into consideration that ObjectBox is currently in beta (version 0.9.7 ).

21\. [**FlowLayout**](https://github.com/nex3z/FlowLayout)  
This library:

> _‚Äúallows child views flow to next row when there is not enough space.¬†  
> The spacing between child views can be calculated by the FlowLayout so that the views are evenly placed.‚Äù_














Please note that this is still in its early stages of development.

22\. [**Unofficial Google Actions Java SDK**](https://github.com/frogermcs/Google-Actions-Java-SDK)This is a polish accent from [Mirek Stanek](https://medium.com/@froger_mcs). Because of the fact that the official Google Actions SDK is written in Node.js, he introduced his unofficial version written natively in Java. According to the _README:_

> _‚ÄúGoogle Actions Java SDK is built based on official Node.js library, but it‚Äôs not a mirror copy of it. The goal is to make it fully compatible with_ [_Conversational Protocol_](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/conversation) _of Assistant Platform.‚Äù_

23\. [**Wearable Reply**](https://github.com/klinker24/wearable-reply)On 9th of February 2017 Google released a new [Android Wear 2.0](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/AndroidWear2.html).¬†  
[Luke Klinker](https://twitter.com/lukeklinker) found a missing API and released the library for this OS. It:

> _‚Äúallows for quick and easy text input, whether that is from your voice, a keyboard, or canned responses. The missing API is now available!‚Äù_

24\. [**Shortbread**](https://github.com/MatthiasRobbers/shortbread)This is a library:

> _‚Äúgenerates_ [_app shortcuts_](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts.html) _for Activities and methods annotated with_ `_@Shortcut_`_. No need to touch the manifest, create XML files or use the shortcut manager. Just annotate the code that you want the shortcut to call.‚Äù_

Currently, it‚Äôs at version 1.0.0.

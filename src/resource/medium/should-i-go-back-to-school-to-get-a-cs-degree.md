# Should I go back to school to get a Computer Science degree?

This week’s question for my “[Ask Preethi](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-are-the-most-challenging-parts-of-your-coding-journey-fbd7d3a7600f)’ series is one that’s near and dear to me, because I too once struggled to figure out the right answer.

### The Question:

“I have been teaching myself to code for almost a year now. I initially started from [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freecodecamp.com/) and other tutorials.

“The more I learn about web technologies like JavaScript, the more I want to learn lower level languages like C++.

“A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development.

“I have also read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers who don’t know enough to be productive. So I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school.

“I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven’t received one response regarding an interview.

**“I would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies?”**

### Here’s my answer

Everyone’s circumstances are different— including timing, affordability, job obligations, family responsibilities, and so much more.

Therefore, while I don’t have a silver bullet answer to this question, I’ll share how I evaluated this decision for myself:

Here are three links worth your time:

1.  GitHub just released a massive guide to contributing to open source ([5 to 60 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kpQidz))
2.  A new way to browse the web — with trails instead of tabs ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kJWrgI))
3.  An animated guide to sorting algorithms ([3 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2lhtlIT))

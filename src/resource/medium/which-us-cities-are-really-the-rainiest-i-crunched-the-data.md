# Which US cities are really the rainiest? I crunched the¬†data.

[Sam Ramji](https://medium.com/@sramji) was surprised: His flight to Seattle was delayed because of rain.

Seattle is famous for being a rainy city, so how could their airport not be prepared to deal with rain?

Well, let‚Äôs take a look at Seattle‚Äôs historical rainfall data to see whether this day was indeed unusual. And while we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs see which cities in the US are the rainiest.

First check: How much has it rained? [NOAA](http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/get.php?wfo=sew&pil=rrm&sid=sew) tells us they‚Äôve seen 1.64 inches of rain in the last 24 hours, and most of it in the last 12:

Is that a lot? A quick check with BigQuery can show us:

In the last 17 years, it only rained more than this on 1 to 3 days per year. And years like 2000, 2002, 2014, and 2016, it never rained this much.

So yes, that‚Äôs a lot of rain for only 12 hours.

### The rainiest US¬†cities

Usually people rank the wettest cities by the amount of rain they get in a year. Not me. I want to know how many days of rain each city had. Was Seattle the worst?

These are the top 60 weather stations, by number of rainy days during the past 17 years:

The the top 60 stations, by number of rainy days during the last 17 years



Alaska and Hawaii show up the top with the most rainy days: The Hilo international aiport in Hawaii saw 4,715 rainy days in the last 17 years, while the Cold Bay airport in Alaska saw 4,515\. With an average temperature of 73¬∞F (versus 39¬∞F), you know where I would rather be. üòÄ

The Seattle-Tacoma airport in this ranking shows up #37, with 2,851 rainy days. So not the rainiest places in the US, but definitely in the top 60\. Pittsburgh had it worse, with 2,960 (#40). Portland lives up to its reputation: 3,126 days (#26).

So if you are [only happy when it rains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBFOJ3R0M4), now you know where to go.

### How I did all¬†this

#### Getting the wettest days for¬†Seattle:

<pre name="5e3b" id="5e3b" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--h4">#standardSQL  
SELECT year, MAX(prcp) max_year, COUNTIF(prcp>1.64) days_over_164, name   
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*` a  
JOIN (  
  SELECT name, CAST(usaf AS STRING) usaf, CAST(wban AS STRING) wban  
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`  
  WHERE name LIKE 'SEATTLE-TACOMA%'  
  AND state='WA'  
)  b  
ON a.wban=b.wban AND b.usaf=a.stn   
WHERE prcp!=99.99  
GROUP BY year, name  
ORDER BY year</pre>

Some notes:

*   I had to CAST() some keys before doing the JOIN. We‚Äôll fix [the underlying datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/#noaa-gsod)! Anyway, BigQuery can handle JOINs over arbitrary keys, so that wasn‚Äôt a big problem.
*   When NOAA doesn‚Äôt have the real data for a point, they replace it with a ‚Äú99.99‚Äù. I filtered those rows out, and you should do the same before running any AVG() or similar operations.
*   4.6 inches of rain in 2003? Surely that‚Äôs a lot! In fact, it [broke all records](http://www.seattleweatherblog.com/weather-records/seattles-rainiest-day/) for Seattle‚Äôs rainiest days. This was after they had the [driest summer on record](http://www.historylink.org/File/5630).

#### Getting the rainiest US cities, by number of rainy¬†days:

<pre name="c38b" id="c38b" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--h4">#standardSQL  
SELECT name, country, state, COUNTIF(prcp>0) rainy_days_17_years, COUNT(DISTINCT year) years, lat, lon  
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*` a  
JOIN (  
  SELECT name, CAST(usaf AS STRING) usaf, CAST(wban AS STRING) wban, country, state, lat, lon  
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`  
  WHERE country='US'  
)  b  
ON a.wban=b.wban AND b.usaf=a.stn   
WHERE prcp!=99.99   
GROUP BY name, country, state, lat, lon  
HAVING years=17  
ORDER BY rainy_days_17_years DESC  
LIMIT 60</pre>

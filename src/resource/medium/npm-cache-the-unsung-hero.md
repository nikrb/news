# npm cache: the unsungÂ hero

I love npm and believe that this package manager is the single biggest reason for JavaScriptâ€™s massive success these past few years.

There was a lot of excitement in the JavaScript community when facebook released yarn. And for good reason. Yarnâ€™s install speeds are amazing. Subsequent installs are even faster because yarn caches installed modules on your machine.

Install speeds @ 12Mbps. Yarn =Â ðŸš€



But thereâ€™s an npm feature that does not get nearly the attention it deserves.

Like Yarn, npm also has a built-in caching mechanism that can make subsequent installs super fast.

Here are some benchmarks:

npm + cache is as fast as yarn + cache (if notÂ faster)



Thatâ€™s crazy, right? And guess what: this feature has been available to you this whole time, but itâ€™s disabled by default.

### How to enable npmÂ cache

<pre name="df9f" id="df9f" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--h3">npm config set cache-min `9999999`</pre>

Thatâ€™s it.

Now install your packages as usual:

<pre name="764c" id="764c" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">npm install express</pre>

You can try out these benchmarks for yourself using [this repository](https://github.com/siddharthkp/npm-cache-benchmark):

Note that Yarn is not just about speedâ€Šâ€”â€Šit has [other features](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/10/11/introducing-yarn) like consistent installs, which set it apart.

But, if speed is an important consideration for youâ€Šâ€”â€Šas it sure is for meâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou should give npm another try, this time with cache.

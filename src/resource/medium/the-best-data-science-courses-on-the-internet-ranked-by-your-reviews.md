A year and a half ago, I dropped out of one of the best computer science programs in Canada. I started creating my own [data science master’s program](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412#.5fwwphdqd) using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.

I’m almost finished now. I’ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role.So I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.

For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few [coding classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.42hhzxopw) for the beginner data scientist. Then it was [statistics and probability classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9#.p7pac546r). Then [introductions to data science](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e). Then [data visualization](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/an-overview-of-every-data-visualization-course-on-the-internet-9ccf24ea9c9b). [Machine learning](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/every-single-machine-learning-course-on-the-internet-ranked-by-your-reviews-3c4a7b8026c0) was the fifth and latest guide. And now I’m back to conclude this series with even more resources.

### **Here’s a summary of all my previous guides, plus recommendations for 13 other data science topics.**

For each of the five major guides in this series, I spent several hours trying to identify every online course for the subject in question, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. My goal was to identify the three best courses available for each subject and present them to you.

The 13 supplemental topics — like databases, big data, and general software engineering — didn’t have enough courses to justify full guides. But over the past eight months, I kept track of them as I came across them. I also scoured the internet for courses I may have missed.

For these tasks, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community, and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*u1dxHyShejSN3cgXGFQIAA.png)

Class Central’s [homepage](https://www.class-central.com/).







Since 2011, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) founder [Dhawal Shah](https://medium.com/@dhawalhs) has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.

### How we picked courses to consider

Each course within each guide must fit certain criteria. There were subject-specific criteria, then two common ones that each guide shared:

1.  **It must be on-demand or offered every few months.**
2.  **It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials.** Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses. Courses that are strictly videos (i.e. with no quizzes, assignments, etc.) are also excluded.

We believe we covered every notable course that fit the criteria in each guide. There is always a chance that we missed something, though. Please let us know in each guide’s comments section if we left a good course out.

### How we evaluated courses

We compiled average ratings and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.

We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on a variety of factors specific to each subject. The criteria in our intro to programming guide, for example:

1.  **Coverage of the fundamentals of programming.**
2.  **Coverage of more advanced, but useful, topics in programming.**
3.  **How much of the syllabus is relevant to data science?**

### Here are the best courses overall for each of these topics. Together these form a comprehensive data science curriculum.

#### Subject #1: Intro to Programming

#### Software Skills

[Software Testing](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/365/udacity-software-testing) by Udacity

[Software Debugging](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/457/udacity-software-debugging) by Udacity

[Version Control with Git](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/8430/udacity-version-control-with-git) and [GitHub & Collaboration](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/8542/udacity-github-collaboration) by Udacity (updates to Udacity’s popular [How to Use Git & GitHub](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/2661/udacity-how-to-use-git-and-github) course)

Software skills are an [oft-overlooked](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/04/18/learning-everything-else) part of a data science education. Udacity’s testing, debugging, and version control courses introduce three core topics relevant to anyone who deals with code, especially those in team-based environments. Together, the courses have a 4.34-star weighted average rating over 68 reviews. Georgia Tech and Udacity have a [new course](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/8568/udacity-software-analysis-testing) that covers software testing and debugging together, though it is more advanced and not all relevant for data scientists.

[Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/2161/coursera-learning-how-to-learn-powerful-mental-tools-to-help-you-master-tough-subjects) by Dr. Barbara Oakley and the University of California, San Diego via Coursera

[Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/8289/coursera-mindshift-break-through-obstacles-to-learning-and-discover-your-hidden-potential) by Dr. Barbara Oakley and McMaster University via Coursera

Johns Hopkins University’s Building a Data Science Team provides a useful peek into data science in practice. It is an extremely short course that can be completed in a handful of hours and audited for free. Ignore its 3.41-star weighted average rating over 12 reviews, some of which were likely from paying customers.

Dr. Barbara Oakley’s Learning How to Learn and Mindshift aren’t data science courses per se. Learning How to Learn, the [most popular online course ever](https://www.class-central.com/report/mindshift-mooc/), covers best practices shown by research to be most effective for mastering tough subjects, including memory techniques and dealing with procrastination. In Mindshift, she demonstrates how to get the most out of online learning and MOOCs, how to seek out and work with mentors, and the secrets to avoiding career ruts and general ruts in life. These are two courses that _everyone_ should take. They have a 4.74-star and a 4.87-star weighted average rating over 959 and 407 reviews, respectively. Both courses are four weeks in duration.

### This Future of This Guide

This Data Science Career Guide will continue to be updated as new courses are released and ratings and reviews for them are generated.

Are you passionate about another discipline (e.g. Computer Science)? Would you like to help educate the world? If you are interested in creating a Career Guide similar in structure to this one, drop us a note at [guides@class-central.com](mailto:guides@class-central.com).

### My Future

As for my future, I’m excited to share that I have taken a position with Udacity as a [Content Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9fNvHdmKc). That means I’ll be creating and teaching courses. That also means that this guide will be updated by somebody else.

I’m joining Udacity because I believe they are creating the best education product on the planet. Of all of the courses I have taken, online or at university, I learned best while enrolled a Nanodegree. They are incorporating the latest in pedagogy and production, and still boast the best-in-class project review system, upbeat instructors, and healthy student and career support teams. Though a piecewise approach like the one we took in this guide can work, a cohesive program with projects and reviews throughout is much more student-friendly.

What is a Nanodegree?



Updating the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) is my first task, which is a part of a larger effort to create a clear path of Nanodegrees for all things data. Students will soon be able to start from scratch with data basics at Udacity and progress all the way through [machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009), [artificial intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/ai), and even [self-driving cars](https://www.udacity.com/drive) if they wish.

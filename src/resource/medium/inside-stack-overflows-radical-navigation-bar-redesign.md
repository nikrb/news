Here are three links worth your time:

1.  Inside Stack Overflow’s radical navigation bar redesign ([7 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lpmfkX))
2.  How I built a game that won the 2016 Azure Machine Learning Award ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mcqFKg))
3.  D3 and Canvas in 3 steps ([22 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lvryOj))

Bonus: US Today — America’s most widely-read newspaper — wrote about my automation article after Mark Cuban tweeted it ([3 minute read](http://usat.ly/2lFXZvo))

### Thought of the day:

> “There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone.” — Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++)

### Image of the day:

A light-weight engine block created by a [deep learning generative design](http://bit.ly/2loYgSU) algorithm.

# I built a serverless Telegram bot over the weekend. Here‚Äôs what I¬†learned.











![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IU6691dCvEaCl46zvhZMrg.jpeg)












I built a Telegram chatbot that sends out a SOS to rescuers when someone is stranded in the rain. It‚Äôs written in Python using AWS Lambda, Zappa and Flask.

You can try it [here](https://t.me/UmbrellaNetworkBot). I haven‚Äôt added in persistence yet üòÖ but I think some of this here might be useful to anyone else interested in a similar project.

I normally have a hard time getting my fianc√©e to discuss technology. It‚Äôs come to a point where she can‚Äôt help but stifle a yawn once I say ‚Äúcode‚Äù.

Imagine my surprise this weekend when she asked me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpretty much out of the blue‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow much it would cost to make a mobile app.

I love being able to talk to her about tech



After losing it for a bit, here‚Äôs what I found out.

### **The problem**

My fianc√©e‚Äôs workplace is close to two MRT stations but there aren‚Äôt any covered paths from the MRT stations to her building. When it rains, people without umbrellas get stranded at the stations. She and her colleagues often head down to help friends out, but there are often more people stranded there than they expected.

Her colleagues were discussing if an app could help solve this. Well, I thought that a chatbot might be able to have the same functions (such as sending out request for umbrellas, location sharing, getting replies). And you could avoid convincing people to download another app.

Since I‚Äôd been meaning to try out Telegram‚Äôs bot APIs for awhile now, I volunteered to help build out a prototype so we could see how interesting this might actually be.

### The chatbot

I started working on this on Saturday afternoon and went to bed at 2am on Sunday. But I‚Äôm really happy to have gone from knowing nothing about the bot APIs to being able to make something like this.

**Anyone can request an umbrella.** The bot asks where the person is, how many umbrellas he/she might need, and when they‚Äôd like to be picked up (the options are limited so we don‚Äôt tax our rescuers too much).












This is what the chatbot does when you request an¬†umbrella



**People can register to be rescuers.** A little good karma goes a long way üòä












This is how someone becomes a¬†rescuer



**Rescuers get notified whenever someone near them is stranded in the rain.** I wanted to make it clear to rescuers whether they were responsible for the request once they had pressed ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.












This is how a rescuer receives and answers a¬†request



In the process I learned a few tricks about making the development a lot faster. I spent almost six hours before I managed to find the right tools and a development workflow that worked for me. Building the bot logic took me a much shorter time.

### What I¬†used

#### AWS Lambda

Instead of running a server 24/7, you can host functions in Lambda so that the server only lasts for the lifecycle of the request. It‚Äôs great for prototypes since you get 1 million free requests a month.

#### Zappa

[This](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) automates the steps needed to get your local Python code onto AWS Lambda. It also configures Amazon‚Äôs API Gateway so you have a nice HTTPS endpoint to host your chatbot functions.

#### ngrok

[This](https://ngrok.com/) makes any local servers reachable via the internet. It‚Äôs a great way to prototype web-hooks before actually deploying them to the cloud.

These tools helped me avoid a lot of the headache that goes into making a chatbot (e.g. renting a server, configuring it for HTTPS, figuring out how to make the server non-blocking since this is a chatbot).

Today I‚Äôll show you how I used these tools to develop the chatbot above. Hope this will help someone else on a similar journey.

### Walkthrough

This tutorial assumes that you‚Äôre making a chatbot with no knowledge of how Telegram‚Äôs bot API works, but with a working knowledge of Flask and Python. If anything seems too simple for you, feel free to skip ahead!

#### Create a Telegram¬†bot

Visit the [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather). Type `/newbot` and follow his instructions to set up a new bot.












And just like this we have a chatbot setup on Telegram!



‚ö° **Pro tip:** save the token somewhere, we‚Äôll be using it soon!

Feel free to play around with the bot‚Äôs profile picture, about text, and description to give it whatever personality you want. Typing `/help` with the Botfather gives you the full list of settings you can tweak for your bot.

#### Set up a development server with¬†Flask

I worked with [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) to manage my project‚Äôs Python dependencies. If you‚Äôre still using pip and virtualenv I encourage you guys to give this a try. There‚Äôs installation instructions at the link.

Next we‚Äôll install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). We‚Äôll also use the awesome [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library. In your command line type:

<pre name="acac" id="acac" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">pipenv install flask  
pipenv install requests</pre>

After flask is installed, we‚Äôll set up a basic server to test our bot. Copy the following text into a file called `server.py`¬†.

‚ö° **Pro tip:** Make sure you replace `<your-bot-token>` with the API token we got from the Botfather.

Let‚Äôs break down what this is doing. Telegram‚Äôs API works this way. Firstly, when someone sends your bot a message, that message gets sent to Telegram‚Äôs servers. Telegram then forwards us that message to whatever we specify as our web-hook as a POST request.

<iframe width="700" height="250" data-src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/f9d6e84ceed0f2cd3bdc87630076596a?postId=227f842f4706" data-media-id="f9d6e84ceed0f2cd3bdc87630076596a" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F8145610%3Fv%3D4%26s%3D400&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" class="progressiveMedia-iframe js-progressiveMedia-iframe" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The function `process_update()` and the decorator above it says that when anyone POSTs to the domain `[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)/<your-bot-token>`¬†, we will extract the JSON data from it. If it‚Äôs a normal text message, it will have the key `message` in the JSON. We check for that and if it‚Äôs a normal message, we reply using `process_message(update)`¬†.

<iframe width="700" height="250" data-src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/e178e465134a9e7d01f2a56a505af392?postId=227f842f4706" data-media-id="e178e465134a9e7d01f2a56a505af392" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F8145610%3Fv%3D4%26s%3D400&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" class="progressiveMedia-iframe js-progressiveMedia-iframe" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>








The function `process_message()` constructs the payload that the Telegram API is expecting if we want to reply to the message. We basically need to specify our reply text in `data["text"]` and the chat we‚Äôre replying to in `data["chat_id"]`¬†.

Finally, we send a POST request with this payload to the [Telegram API endpoint for the](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage) `[sendMessage](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage)` [method](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage). This allows us to send a message programmatically.

**Time to run the server.** Now in your command prompt type:

<pre name="3516" id="3516" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">pipenv shell</pre>

This activates the virtual environment and gives us access to Flask. Now we need to run the server locally. Type in the command prompt:

<pre name="f2c8" id="f2c8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">export FLASK_APP=server.py  
flask run</pre>

We have a running server! If you didn‚Äôt mess with the defaults, this is running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)/.

Read more at the Flask documentation and [quick-start](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/).

But this is running locally, and Telegram‚Äôs bot API can‚Äôt send its POST requests to a local URL. Hence we‚Äôll use **ngrok** to expose this local server to the internet.

#### Use ngrok to make the local server accessible on the¬†internet

Get the package for your operating system from [this link on the ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download). Once you‚Äôve downloaded and installed it, go to the directory that you unzipped the file into and run the following command in the command prompt.

<pre name="7318" id="7318" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">./ngrok http 5000</pre>

You‚Äôll see something similar in your command prompt. Now whatever server you‚Äôre running on localhost:5000 is exposed at the following URLs.














‚ö° **Pro tip:** Copy the https url, we‚Äôre going to use it soon.

**Time to let Telegram know what our web-hook address is.** We‚Äôll use the Telegram API again to set our web-hook.

Create a file called `webhook.py` with the following content:

<iframe width="700" height="250" data-src="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/media/8ce78f8e50c444e8b2bef667e6cddba0?postId=227f842f4706" data-media-id="8ce78f8e50c444e8b2bef667e6cddba0" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F8145610%3Fv%3D4%26s%3D400&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" class="progressiveMedia-iframe js-progressiveMedia-iframe" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>






[https://gist.github.com/mosessoh/c047821e963562cc5701802ad3b6e147](https://gist.github.com/mosessoh/c047821e963562cc5701802ad3b6e147)



‚ö° **Pro tip:** Remember to replace `<your-bot-token>` and `<your-https-url>`¬†!

`pprint` lets us print out nicely formatted JSON data. We send our web-hook URL as a POST request to the `[setWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook)` [endpoint](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) of the Telegram API. Now run the following lines in your command prompt:

<pre name="c455" id="c455" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">pipenv install pprint  
python webhook.py</pre>

You should see `200` and a JSON block with `'ok': True`¬†.

#### Test out your¬†chatbot

Now we‚Äôre done with setting up our server. Head over to your bot in Telegram, and say hello! If everything‚Äôs been set up correctly, you‚Äôll see it reply `I can hear you!`

In the next part of this tutorial, we‚Äôll learn how to deploy this server onto the internet using Zappa and AWS Lambda. Give this a couple of claps if this was helpful for you‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôd love to know if it was. Thanks üôè

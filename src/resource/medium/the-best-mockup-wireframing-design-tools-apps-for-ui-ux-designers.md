# The Best Mockup & Wireframing Design Tools & Apps for UI/UX Designers



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7wk-KpPqZiZUxHfQ.jpg)



Prototyping/wireframing tools are the best communication method between interaction designers, [project manager](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/the-project-manager-vs-product-manager-what-are-the-differences-relations/?r=grace-d), and website developers. It’s a key step of the web or mobile app development process. While in principle, the design of prototypes must be a product of [interaction designers](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/stepbystep-guide-become-an-excellent-interaction-designer), and the user-centered concept shall run through the whole product design progress. The professional perspective and rich **user experience** of interaction designer will directly influence the [usability of the product](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/usability-design/?r=grace-y).

### Desktop-based Prototyping Tools

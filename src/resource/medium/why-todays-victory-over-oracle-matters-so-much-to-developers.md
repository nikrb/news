# Who won Google VS Oracle? Developers won.

The sun sets on Oracle‚Äôs data cylinder-inspired headquarters.







Google has successfully defended itself from a [$9 billion lawsuit from Oracle](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/oracle-google-case-will-decide-future-software/). In doing so, Google‚Äôs lawyers have prevented a dangerous precedent that would have given old copyright-hoarding tech companies a way to sue lots of startups and open source projects.

If this is the first you‚Äôve heard about the trial, I don‚Äôt blame you. It was basically just a bunch of lawyers trying to explain the intricacies of APIs and copyright law to a jury of non-technical Californians, using metaphors like [file cabinets and bookshelves](http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/23/2961991/inside-oracle-vs-google-courtroom-questions-code-a-file-cabinet).

Here‚Äôs a rough timeline of how the whole conflict unfolded:

**2005**: Google acquires Android. They opt to use Java over Microsoft‚Äôs C#, negotiate with Sun Microsystems, who own Java, but fail to secure a licensing deal.

**2006**: Google rejects Sun‚Äôs alleged offer of a three-year Java license for $20 million plus 10% of Google‚Äôs Android-related revenue, capped at $25 million.

**2007**: Google publicly announces Android, and its use of Dalvik, a Java-compatible virtual machine.

**2010**: Oracle acquires Sun for its Java patents and copyrights, then files a lawsuit accusing Google of infringing upon seven of Sun‚Äôs Java patents.

**2011**: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office dismisses five of the seven patent allegations. Oracle seeks damages of up to $6 billion. A settlement can‚Äôt be reached.

**2012:** Oracle and Google go to trial in a San Francisco district court and Google wins.

**2014:** An appeals court reverses the district court‚Äôs decision, stating that an API is copyrightable.

**2016:** A second trial starts over whether Google‚Äôs use of Java‚Äôs APIs was [fair use](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq).

Sarah Jeong, a law and technology journalist who covered the trial [in detail](https://storify.com/sarahjeong) since it began, announced its conclusion in with this tweet:

Throughout the lawsuit, I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about Oracle‚Äôs place in this classic collection of tech company organizational charts:

You‚Äôre probably asking, ‚ÄúOK. So one massive multinational corporation doesn‚Äôt need to give $9 billion to another massive multinational corporation. How is this a win for me as a developer?‚Äù

Well, if you‚Äôre developing software‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor plan to in the future‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis means that Google‚Äôs lawyers just steered you around a massive intellectual property minefield. They were able to prevent Oracle from setting a dangerous precedent: that a company could successfully sue you for writing your own functionally similar implementation of their APIs.

Unfortunately, the case isn‚Äôt closed yet. Oracle has vowed to appeal the decision yet again. And this ruling could still be overturned.

Either way, the fact that Oracle was able to get so close to a verdict in their favor is pretty terrifying, and may embolden other companies that hold copyrights on APIs to start suing startups and open source projects, too.

For example, a company called Micro Focus owns Unix, which among other things uses an API called POSIX. They could start suing developers who maintain versions of Linux and other Unix-compatible open source operating systems.

We‚Äôre not out of the woods yet, but all of us developers in the open source world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the people who use our software‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan breathe a momentary sigh of relief.

If you have time, check out [Sarah Jeong‚Äôs account](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-the-very-silly-oracle-v-google-trial-actually-matters) of how absurd this trial was, and how disastrous an Oracle victory would have been for everyone but Oracle.

# Here are the 10 all-time most-downloaded Ruby gems
















Source: [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/stats?page=1)







Ruby sure has matured well over time! It’s fun to see how the community has progressed — here’s the top 10 all time most downloaded ruby gems!

It comes as a shock that [Rails is holding the #22 spot](https://rubygems.org/stats?page=3) with 111,286,051 downloads.

Without further ado, here are our winners, followed by their official descriptions.

#### **1\.** [**bundler**](http://bundler.io)**— whopping** 208,402,476 downloads!

_Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed._

Of course! Who else than the bundler itself!

#### 2\. [**multi_json**](https://github.com/intridea/multi_json)** — **181,294,528

_Lots of Ruby libraries parse JSON and everyone has their favorite JSON coder. Instead of choosing a single JSON coder and forcing users of your library to be stuck with it, you can use MultiJSON instead, which will simply choose the fastest available JSON coder._

#### 3\. [**rake**](https://github.com/ruby/rake/)** — **178,682,224

_Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax._

Extremely useful for creating tasks.

#### 4\. [rack](https://github.com/rack/rack/stargazers) — 177,749,320

_Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call._

#### 5\. [**json**](https://rubygems.org/gems/json)** — **170,343,931

_json is a JSON implementation as a Ruby extension in C._

#### 6\. [mime-types](https://rubygems.org/gems/mime-types) — 166,471,989

_The mime-types library provides a library and registry for information about MIME content type definitions. It can be used to determine defined filename extensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely MIME type definitions._

#### 7\. [activesupport](https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport) — 157,954,210

_A toolkit of support libraries and Ruby core extensions extracted from the Rails framework. Rich support for multibyte strings, internationalization, time zones, and testing._

#### 8\. [thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) — 153,208,006

_Thor is a toolkit for building powerful command-line interfaces._

#### 9\. [i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/) — 152,903,719

#### 10\. [diff-lcs](https://rubygems.org/gems/diff-lcs) — 147,630,418

_Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using the McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes utilities to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool._

If you’re a Ruby developer, you may have heard most of the packages. If so, great job! It’s always fun to look at statistics (true nerd baller).

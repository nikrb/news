# Best Gitter channels for: Game Developers

Today we have probably the most fun collection of Gitter communities — those for game developers. No matter if you’ve already spent hours developing and playing games, or if you are looking to get started; no matter if you are into indie fantasy games or tic tac toe — you will find something for yourself. (Our team’s personal favourite is Particle Clicker — game teaching the history of high energy particle physics). Get lost in the open source world of gamers on Gitter, and be prepared to stay there for hours…

[History of Crayola Colors](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery/history-crayola-colors) by Stephen Wagner via Tableau Public.







A year ago, I dropped out of one of the best computer science programs in Canada. I started creating my own [data science master’s program](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412#.5fwwphdqd) using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.

I’m almost finished now. I’ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role. **A few months ago, I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.**

For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few [coding classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.42hhzxopw) for the beginner data scientist. Then it was [statistics and probability classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9#.p7pac546r). Then it was [intros to data science](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e#.5qdvv8dui) itself.

### Now onto data visualization.

For this guide, I spent 10+ hours trying to identify every online data visualization course offered as of March 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. For this task, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PEbx8gPbRHuABqdNw0_dDw.png)

Class Central’s [homepage](https://www.class-central.com/).







Since 2011, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) founder [Dhawal Shah](https://www.class-central.com/@dhawal) has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.

### How we picked courses to consider

Each course must fit three criteria:

1.  **The majority of the course must be focused on _explanatory_ data visualization.** Coverage of data preparation, for example, is permitted given it is an important part of the data visualization process. Courses that cover less relevant topics (statistical modeling, for example) are excluded. More on the _explanatory_ distinction below.
2.  **It must be on-demand or offered every few months.**
3.  **It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials**. Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses.

We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only. There’s always a chance that we missed something, though, so please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.

### How we evaluated courses

We compiled average rating and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.

We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on **two** factors, with the first given preference over the second:

1.  **Coverage of data visualization theory.** Are the motivations for visualization choices explained? Does the course only teach the tool? More on this in the next section.
2.  **Coverage of chosen data visualization tool(s).** Does the course effectively teach common visualization tools (Tableau, ggplot2, Seaborn, etc.)? Do students have opportunities to practice these skills? No preference for tool choice is given.







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8-VsMmEK5ozzZWRlndn3UA.png)





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NZaS9s72U3ci_bFafoB2YQ.png)

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) are common data visualization tools.







### Why prioritize visualization theory

Mastery of a specific tool is wasteful without knowledge of the fundamentals of effective visualization. Plus, tools are often interchangeable depending on the setting.

More importantly, doing good data visualization is more complex than most people think. Careful thought is required from the planning stages to execution. Choosing the right chart, balancing complexity and clutter, leveraging [preattentive properties](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/), and more, data visualization is both an art and a science. It is easy to go wrong, and sometimes horribly (see below).

### Exploratory vs. explanatory visualization

As [described](https://github.com/yy/dviz-course/wiki/Exploratory-vs.-explanatory-visualization) by Indiana University professor Yong-Yeol Ahn, the aim of _explanatory_ data visualization is to communicate insights and messages, while the aim of _exploratory_ visualization is to discover hidden patterns.

This article focuses on **explanatory** data visualization courses. Courses like Udacity’s [Data Analysis with R](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/1478/udacity-data-analysis-with-r) (exclusively an exploratory course) are therefore excluded from this article. The topic is important; there just aren’t enough courses to justify a standalone article. It will be covered briefly in the summary article for this series.

### Coding experience sometimes required

Some courses listed below require basic coding skills in the course’s language of instruction. If you have very little programming experience, our recommendations in the first article in this series — the best intro to [programming](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.ld31z08y5) courses for data science — would be a great start. Both Python and R courses are covered.

### Review data lacking

Compared to the other articles in this series, there is a lack of review data for data visualization courses that fit the above criteria. There is also no _clear_ best data visualization course yet. The recommendations below are therefore not as conclusive as past articles. As always, but especially here, try to pick the course that best fits your needs.











* * *







### Our pick for the best data visualization course is…

*   [Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=467035.1&type=10&u1=cc-medium-career-guide-dataviz&tmpid=18061&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fdata-visualization) by the University of California, Davis on Coursera

…which contains the following five courses:

*   [Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/6808/coursera-fundamentals-of-visualization-with-tableau)
*   [Essential Design Principles for Tableau](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/6809/coursera-essential-design-principles-for-tableau)
*   [Visual Analytics with Tableau](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/7621/coursera-visual-analytics-with-tableau)
*   [Creating Dashboards and Storytelling with Tableau](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/6806/coursera-creating-dashboards-and-storytelling-with-tableau)
*   [Data Visualization with Tableau Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dataviz-project)

The University of California, Davis’ Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization has the best combination of theory and tool coverage available based on this article’s evaluation criteria. It dives deep into theory like few other courses. There are opportunities to practice Tableau via walkthroughs and a final project, though mastering Tableau is not the main focus. It is a fairly new specialization (late 2016) and the courses only have one **4**-star rating between them on the review sites used for this analysis.

Govind Acharya, Hunter Whitney, and Suk Brar are the instructors. Acharya is a Principal Analyst at UC Davis. Whitney and Brar are respected industry professionals. Between them, they have decades of data visualization experience that is clearly conveyed through the course content. The videos are well-produced.

The estimated timeline for the specialization on Coursera is 22 weeks with weekly commitments ranging from three to eight hours per week. These estimates are assuredly too high, as noted by several reviewers and my experience with Coursera. Free (auditing each course individually) and paid (paying for the Specialization) options are currently available.

Several prominent reviewers on Coursera noted the following:

> They not only tell you how to do the visualization design but also tell you why (the physiology, the principles). I would highly recommend this class.

> Great course — guards against some subtle pitfalls in visualization preparation.

> Although a very basic introduction to the use of Tableau, the course provides a broad and interesting background that should prove useful to anyone seeking to enhance their understanding of visualization fundamentals.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*iMyD8hpkT3bkior2tECr1w.jpeg)

[Govind Acharya](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/govind-acharya) and [Hunter Whitney](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/hunter-whitney) are instructors for the [Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=467035.1&type=10&u1=cc-medium-career-guide-dataviz&tmpid=18061&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fdata-visualization).







### Visualization theory and R, learned by doing

*   Data Visualization with ggplot2 by DataCamp

…for which there are three parts:

*   [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=93618-a68c98)
*   [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=93618-a68c98)
*   [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 3)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-part-3?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=93618-a68c98)

Another great option is DataCamp’s Data Visualization with ggplot2 series, especially if you want to learn R and, more specifically, [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/). A substantial amount of theory is covered, which is fitting given that ggplot2 is inspired by [The Grammar of Graphics](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447). Tool coverage and practice are impressive as well — you will know R and its quirky syntax quite well leaving these courses. There are no reviews for these courses on the review sites used for this analysis.

The instructor for all three courses is [Rick Scavetta](https://twitter.com/Rick_Scavetta), who is a biologist, workshop trainer, freelance data scientist, and cofounder of Science Craft. DataCamp’s hybrid teaching style leverages video (starring Scavetta) and text-based instruction with lots of examples through an in-browser code editor. The video, text, and code content is polished nicely.

Together, the estimated timeline for all three courses is 16 hours. The first chapter of each course is available for free. A DataCamp [subscription](https://www.datacamp.com/pricing), which is currently $29 per month or $300 per year, is required for full access.

The following [endorsement](http://flowingdata.com/2016/02/18/learn-the-basics-of-ggplot2-interactively/) is from [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), Chief Scientist at RStudio and ggplot2 creator:

> I thoroughly recommend “Data Visualization with ggplot2” by Rick Scavetta. It gives you an excellent introduction to ggplot2\. You’ll learn both the underlying theory, and get hands on practice in DataCamp’s online learning environment.

### **A practical intro to Tableau with an excellent instructor**

Tableau 10 Series by Kirill Eremenko and the SuperDataScience Team on Udemy, which includes:

*   [Tableau 10 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&u1=cc-career-guide-dataviz&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftableau10%2F)
*   [Tableau 10 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=323058.1&type=10&u1=cc-career-guide-dataviz&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ftableau10-advanced%2F)

Taught by Kirill Eremenko, SuperDataScience’s Tableau 10 Series is an effective practical introduction. It focuses mostly on tool coverage (Tableau) rather than data visualization theory. Eremenko is one of the most well-regarded instructors in these guides with consistently positive reviews across of his courses. The A-Z course is a prerequisite to the Advanced Training course. Together, the courses in the series have a 4.6-star weighted average rating over 3,724 reviews.

The series has seventeen hours of video content. The cost of each course varies depending on Udemy discounts, but these are are frequent, and can be purchased for as little as $10.

Several prominent reviewers noted the following:

_This was great. I use Tableau daily but it was an awesome refresher on some of the items_ i _don’t use and a great study aid for sitting the Tableau Certified Professional Exam. Good job Kirill and the Team!_

_Kirill is a tremendous teacher and students taking this course will clearly see why he has dozens of courses and thousands of students — he’s able to teach complex skills, in a real world business context and do so incrementally thereby combining the often complex task of teaching both fundamentals and context specific applications simultaneously._
